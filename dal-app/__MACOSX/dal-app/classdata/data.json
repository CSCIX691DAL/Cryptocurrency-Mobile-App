A lively look at the growth of urban life in the West, at the limits of Roman identity throughout the empire, at the fearful economic and military crisis of the 3rd century, at the adoption of official Christianity, and at the challenges of foreign invasion will lead us to ponder whether the \"Decline and Fall\" model of Roman imperial history is still valid.

Which atrocities are included in that concept and why? What is the relation between “genocide” and “human rights”? Does the fact that the term was coined in a specific context (after WWII) limit its applicability to non-European phenomena, both prior to and after the war? We will consider several documented instances of genocidal violence and reflect on the relations between genocide and the politics of memory, including museum displays, public commemorations, and popular culture. We will look at competing claims from victim groups and ask questions about the impact of racism in targeting specific populations; gender difference in the experience of atrocity; and the role of world powers in deciding about intervention or non-intervention.", "creditHours": 3},

This is in large part due to its interdisciplinary nature, which crosses the boundaries of history, sociology, psychology and philosophy. This class will introduce students to some of the topics in Foucault’s major works on the history of madness, the birth of the penitentiary, the history of the human sciences, bio-power, the history of sexuality, and ethics. Readings will include selections from Foucault’s major published works as well as interviews, lectures, and shorter essays. We will pay particular attention to the evolution of Foucault’s methodology from archaeology to genealogy and Foucault’s later claim that the goal of his work from the 1960s to 1980s has been the creation of a history of the different ways in which human beings are made subjects.", "creditHours": 3},

These interpretations have involved as much reconstruction of early modern thought as faithful scholarly commentary.

In recent newspaper and academic articles, Strauss has been seen through the influence of his students (\"Straussians\") to be the secret intellectual source of much of the Neo-Conservative movement and in particular the policies and doctrines of the Bush White House. This course will endeavour to understand Strauss's thought in terms of his own intellectual development and in the context of the issues that were particularly formative for his thinking. The course will include the influence of Husserl upon his thought, his reflections on Zionism and the Jewish intellectual tradition during the 1920s and 30s when he was still living in Germany, his critique of Carl Schmitt, his response to the thought of Martin Heidegger, his debate with Alexandre Kojeve.

His extraordinary influence is the result of his teaching small groups of dedicated students. Published for the most part posthumously, his writings, too, have made him a philosopher's philosopher. Nevertheless, his influence has extended well beyond the questions about the foundations of logic and language which preoccupied him.

From an examination of nineteenth-century “Scriptural geology” and the religious impact of Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859), this course moves on to such contemporary topics as the religious interpretations of quantum mechanics, the Big Bang, the anthropic principle, medical science, bioethics, evolutionary psychology, chaos theory, aesthetics in nature, science fiction, extra-terrestrial life (including the SETI Project) and the quest for technoimmortality. Case studies of “conflict” emanating from Darwinism, the Scopes Trial, the on- going Creation-Evolution debates and the New Atheism are contrasted with examples of harmony and interdependence between science and religion in the careers of modern scientists, along with phenomena like the new Intelligent Design (ID) movement.

In this course, we examine three different strategies for overcoming this view. We begin by examining phenomenological attempts to overcome dualistic accounts of the relations between perceiver and perceived, mind and body, and mind and world. In the next section, we discuss attempts by radical ecologists to establish a nondualist view of the relation between humans and nature. In the concluding section of the course, we examine some postmodern strategies for overcoming dualistic thinking about culture and nature.", "creditHours": 3},

The course will examine the various feminist critiques of natural science, as well as the positive proposals that feminism has brought to science and scientific culture. Questions that will be addressed include: Is the style of science gendered? Has feminism influenced the content of various sciences? How has science contributed to gendered constructions of nature? Is there such a thing as value-free scientific research? How do feminist theories of knowledge differ from traditional understandings of scientific knowledge and scientific objectivity?

In this course, we focus on various modes of talking about this traumatic historical period. Why did the Holocaust happen “in the middle of civilized Europe”? Who were the perpetrators? Does the word “Holocaust” refer only to the Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jewish people or should we also consider the experiences of different victim groups (e.g., the disabled, gay people, and the Roma people)? Did men and women experience the events differently because of their biological gender and social gender norms at the time? Can horror be accommodated in language or represented by any other means? Is the Holocaust unique or should it be considered in comparison with other genocides? These and other questions will arise in this class from the examination of eye-witness accounts from the killing fields in the East, Holocaust diaries written in the ghettoes, memoirs written by survivors of the Nazi camps, and perpetrators’ diaries, as well as works by historians and literary works written by the participants of the events.", "creditHours": 3},

Home is a place of comfort and belonging; it is a domestic setting, a language, a nationality and a series of identifications that ‘place’ and maintain individuals. The notion of home is opposed to key diagnoses of the modern condition--as alienated, displaced, estranged and uncanny, for example. These diagnoses have been applied both to psychological conditions and to actual social phenomena of mass displacements, refugees, immigration and exile. The social imaginary of many historically displaced groups centres around the return to or establishment of a homeland.This course will consider literary and artistic representations of ‘home’, the phenomenology of ‘homeliness’ and of its strange double, the uncanny, and the stakes that post-war philosophy has in the notions of rootedness, place and dwelling.", "creditHours": 3},

That is, can generosity ever really exist? Or are we trapped in restricted economies of exchange which find us always calculating some profit to ourselves, whether in this world or the next? The problem of the possibility of generosity and altruism is of central importance to current deliberations about ethics and economics. This seminar will read its way through the modern genealogy of the thinking of the gift, beginning with its foundation in anthropological studies of so-called 'primitive' economies. It is of some interest that the modern concern with the gift appears in the guise of anthropology rather than from its well-established place in the Christian theological tradition. This course will consider the debate over the gift among anthropologists such as Mary Douglas and Marshall Sahlins, in the extraordinary theses of Georges Bataille, and will place special emphasis on the importance of the gift in the work of Jacques Derrida.", "creditHours": 3},

Are poets and painters engaged in the same field of representation? Do they adopt parallel strategies of representation? Do they interpret and organize social energies in similar ways?", "creditHours": 3},

Although the themes to be covered may vary somewhat, on the philosophical side the main ones will be a selection from the following: theories of representation, theories of perception, theories of concepts and abstract ideas, theories of knowledge and the issue of skepticism (proofs of God and of the external world), metaphysics and ontology, causality, and doctrines of logic and method. What makes the early modern period so intellectually fascinating is that philosophy and science, empirical studies and a priori studies, are interwoven. We shall look at some parts of the tapestries that resulted, especially in the area of cognitive science, especially in Descartes, but also including physics and mathematics, and the contributions of other philosophers of the period.", "creditHours": 3},

Unquestionably, the most famous representation of this modern myth is Goethe’s Faust. Written over a period of sixty years (1772–1832), Goethe’s opus magnum broadens the focus of the original myth to portray the central ambiguities and controversies presented by the modern age. His Faust is the story of modern man at large, successful, egotistical, torn, alienated, driven, in search of truth and totality, a man who in the course of his life becomes spectacularly guilty, and in the end is spectacularly (and controversially) redeemed. Faust’s journey through the world traces major developments of the western world from the sixteenth to the early nineteenth century, developments that still shape today’s world.", "creditHours": 3},

This course will consider the important transformation of romance in the period by concentrating on two main texts, Spenser's The Faerie Queene, and Cervantes' Don Quixote. The course will begin by looking at a few paradigmatic late medieval romances of the fifteenth century, including portions of Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur, and the Spanish romance by Martorel, Tirant lo blanc. The main texts will then be considered as examples of the extraordinary reception of the genre, as continuation, elaboration and allegorization in the case of Spenser, and as the foundation of the novel in the case of Cervantes. Central themes such as quest, errancy, and desire will be considered; there will be a limited number of readings on the theory of romance (Frye, Bakhtin, Parker).

The course will consider several interrelated aspects of scientific culture in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries: first, we will look at the place of women in the scientific institutions of the time. The second part of the course will look at the contributions of some particular women to the fields of physics, astronomy, botany, and medicine. We will then examine how science interpreted sex and gender. Finally, the course will explore the ways in which gender and nature were portrayed in the broader cultural context. We will, for example, discuss the ways in which women were depicted as scientists and as symbols of science in art and literature. ", "creditHours": 3},

These changes also had a great influence on the literature of the period. Some writers were entranced by the new natural science, and sought to disseminate its principles and lionize its most significant figures. Other writers were harshly critical of the emerging notions of scientific progress and domination of nature. This course will examine the ways in which science was portrayed in early modern poetry, prose, and drama, in an attempt to understand how the new science, and new conceptions of nature, were understood and received in the broader philosophical and cultural context.", "creditHours": 3},

By 1800, the sun had replaced the earth at the centre of a limited planetary system situated in infinite space. These changes prompted early modern philosophers, scientists, and writers to consider the possibility that the universe might contain a plurality of worlds. This course will explore the ways in which the “plurality” theme was developed in some of the earliest works of science fiction. We will consider this theme as it appears in stories of intergalactic voyages, utopian societies, and encounters with extraterrestrial beings, paying special attention to the ways in which early modern writers used these tales to speculate on philosophical, political, and scientific issues.", "creditHours": 3},

Happiness was seen as the highest good by some thinkers - as arguably reflected, on a political level, in the American constitution - while others argued against the identification of happiness with goodness. This course will examine various literary and philosophical texts in which the pursuit of happiness in its diverse senses is an important theme.

By the end of the eighteenth century, science, morality, and art were seen as different realms of activity in which questions of truth, justice, and taste could be separately determined, that is, evaluated according to their specific criteria of validity. This course will consider how these differences compelled European philosophers and theologians, artists and social theorists, to develop and expand their self-understanding to the point where enlightened reason could properly reflect the formal divisions of culture and make critical judgements in relation to them.

In early modern England, the burgeoning commercial theatre became a focal point for cultural debates about the social and ethical ramifications of this performative construction of the self. This course will explore these debates both as they relate to the growth of the professional theatre and in terms of their wider implications for early modern English society. We will begin by looking at the roles traditionally played by performance in the affirmation of identities both aristocratic and plebian. We will then go on to examine a number of plays from the main genres performed in English public theatres between 1590 and 1640. By reading these plays alongside primary sources from conduct manuals to statutes for theatre governance, and from playwrights’ celebrations of their art to Puritans’ attacks on the theatre’s degeneracy, we will consider the huge range of cultural responses to the relationship between performance and identity in a rapidly shifting social order.

From an examination of the biblical view of nature, ancient Babylonian astrology and divination, and Plato's Timaeus, this course moves through a treatment of the centrality of theology to Medieval science on to natural theology and the “Watchmaker” Design Argument of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Models of conflict, harmony and complementarity offered to characterize relations between science and religion are explored through case studies such as Galileo’s controversy with the Church and instances where religious belief inspired scientists like Boyle and Newton. Claims that certain confessional traditions (notably Protestantism and its dissenting offshoots) facilitated the rise of modern science are also appraised. Science-religion relations are examined both from the standpoint of mainstream religion and with respect to religious heterodoxy, prophecy, alchemy, magic and witchcraft.

We will consider these questions by examining particular health topics that have a strongly gendered component, such as sexual health, reproductive health, and disability. Throughout the course, we will explore the theoretical perspectives used in the field; the two-sex model and challenges to it; the gendering of particular health problems and health professions; the medicalization of womanhood and, more recently, manhood; and the relationships between gender and other forms of social classification (e.g. race, class, sexual orientation).", "creditHours": 3},

Somewhere in the forties, anxieties about the aging process exacerbate the difficulties facing women in modern society. Disempowering older women is usually accomplished in small increments. “Old woman” is a pejorative label; the older a woman becomes, the less credibility she generally has; this is especially true for women of color, poor women, lesbians, and women who are physically challenged. While aging is a biological phenomenon, ageism is socially constructed. Specifically, under patriarchy, older women are seen as a burden, desexualized and segregated by both men and younger women. They are usually not taken very seriously, nor seen as a threat. This course will explore the issues related to social, psychological, political and economic factors that are major determinants to the well-being of aging women based upon race, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities and class inequities.", "creditHours": 3},

Visual culture is not only becoming more diverse but also increasingly globalized. For these reasons alone, the study of popular visual culture is an important pursuit. But popular images, like all visual images, also carry meaning and generate effects. The first part of this course explores the origins of mass popular culture in 19th Century Britain. Through case studies, suggesting that Western ideas about mental health, gender, romance, weddings and marriage emerged and were transmitted though Victorian visual culture, students learn to see connections between the popular culture of the past and contemporary visuality. Students will also critique the development of cultural studies as a discipline and form their own theoretical positions. In the second part, students will conduct their own self- directed primary research into a visual popular culture topic of their choosing. In the final weeks of the course, students will be asked to reflect on the course as a whole, consolidate what they have learned, and articulate the connections (or disruptions) they see between historical and contemporary theory and practice.

By 1500, innovations in military technology and the paper-making industry allowed for the emergence of centralized and bureaucratically-sophisticated 'gunpowder' empires in western and south Asia. This course will discuss the three most significant of these: the Ottoman Turks (based in Istanbul), the Safavid Persians (based in Isfahan), and the Mughal Indians (based in Delhi). Areas of focus will include: issues of political legitimacy, use of military 'slave' corps, orthodox and popular religious movements, tensions between nomadic and sedentary segments of society, innovations in cultural expression (poetry, art, architecture), scientific and philosophical development, and the penetration and impact of the Portuguese, English, Dutch, and French 'world economies' into Asia and the Indian Ocean. This course will also examine different debates regarding the 'decline of the East', and introduce the theoretical implications of how the Islamic world is approached by contemporary scholarship.", "creditHours": 3},

But the antecedents of the British Raj arguably have its roots in the island of Ceylon, more than half a century earlier. In this class, we will challenge the thesis that the Raj begins in India by studying the dynamics of empire, war, and resistance on the small island state of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in the Indian Ocean. No prior knowledge of the region is required, this course is meant to introduce students to the global history, politics, and conflicts that contoured the development of modern/colonial Ceylon, known today as “Sri Lanka.” We focus on the imperial conflicts that defined the period of British colonial rule (1802 – 1948), but towards the end of the class, emphasize how these historical events continue to impact post-colonial Sri Lanka in terms of ethnonationalist strife and Asian geopolitics. In so doing, part of the conceptual work of this course is to draw into contention the stability with which we think of the term “post” colonial in terms of states within the former British empire.", "creditHours": 3},

But popular images, like all visual images, also carry meaning and generate effects. The first part of this course explores the origins of mass popular culture in 19th Century Britain. Through case studies, suggesting that Western ideas about mental health, gender, romance, weddings and marriage emerged and were transmitted though Victorian visual culture, students learn to see connections between the popular culture of the past and contemporary visuality. Students will also critique the development of cultural studies as a discipline and form their own theoretical positions. In the second part, students will conduct their own self- directed primary research into a visual popular culture topic of their choosing.

In this seminar, we study the emergence of the modern territorial state with attention to the tensions that emerge when distinct modes of organizing space encounter one another in the modern, colonial era.

As you walk across the Dalhousie campus and go about daily life in Halifax, your actions connect you to people around the globe and to the history of the city and world as well as to the many works of literature, art and music that depict these connections. Here are just a few examples of connections that we will explore in Halifax and the World: Part I (INTD / CANA 1102.03 – Fall semester): Walking across the Dalhousie campus you are traversing what remains unceded Mi'kmaq territory raising hard questions about relations between Settler and First Nations Peoples. While walking downtown on a Friday night you might tread in the footsteps of the central characters in Hugh MacLennan's novel Barometer Rising and other major works of Canadian fiction. As you walk through the city you'll see monuments and statues that commemorate the city's early colonial leaders – which raise questions about how we chose to remember history of the city and its connections to the world.The course will critically examine the connections between daily life in Halifax and broader issues of colonialism, race and class relations, historical memory, ethics and justice through a combination of lectures, guest speakers, discussion groups, field trips, experiential learning in the city of Halifax.

Although it is obvious that much human action is emotionally driven, traditionally many philosophers have expressed skepticism about the value of emotions to rational and ethical conduct. Recently, philosophers such as Martha Nussbaum, Amelie Rorty and Ronald De Sousa have argued powerfully that rationality requires emotions. Other philosophers have argued that we need a renewed assessment of the epistemic importance of emotion in revealing power and value. Topics will include emotional rationality; emotion and value; first person authority; cognitive, social constructivist and psycho-evolutionary approaches; emotion and feminist epistemology; emotion, power and racial construction.", "creditHours": 3},

We then explore the relationship between rationality and other phenomena, e.g.: is it always rational to be moral? Are persons necessarily rational? (What about those with mental health issues?) Would rational persons always be prudent, i.e., always make choices now in the light of desires they expect to have, not just those they currently have? Are good laws necessarily ones people would find it rational to accept and follow? We eventually examine whether rationality is grounded in people's actual desires, or whether there are objective constraints on desires it is rational to have and to choose from, whether desires are relevant at all, and whether there can be a single standard of rationality for all times and all people. Throughout, we apply philosophical accounts of rationality to selected issues of the moment, e.g., to issues in war, governance, democracy, intelligence, and cyber ethics, many of these dealt with as they arise in processing issues being mooted by the American think tank, the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law.

Using British ‘best practice’ ideas of professional policy making and Canadian statements of generic policy competencies, it seeks to improve the policy capacity of participants. It does this first by increasing their knowledge of public policy structures, processes, and outputs, and secondly, by giving them knowledge that they can use in policy advocacy both inside and outside government. The first section of the course examines policy definitions and professional policy making approaches in the 21st century. The second section considers the role of the state in the 21st century, and the policy competencies that analysts must have if that role is to be carried out effectively. Section three explores vertical, horizontal and external policy relationships, both as determinants of policy and as practical matters of management. Section four explores, and helps participants to gain proficiency in, the most recent processes of strategic policy design and implementation. This blend of theory and practice will increase the policy knowledge of all participants, and equip those who are in professional programs, including the various public services, to contribute more effectively to policy processes in the future.SIGNATURE REQUIRED.", "creditHours": 3},

Two of the principle manifestations of this ‘security-development nexus’ have been intrastate wars and collapsed states. In 2011 for example, none of the states emerging from civil war had reached any of the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations. Moreover, the security-development relationship conditions our capacity to develop effective policies on how and whether to intervene in 'fragile' or 'collapsed' states where the security environment is highly problematic, and our capacity to contribute to the economic and human development of these countries. This course aims, first, to give students a broad understanding of the various dimensions of the security-development nexus; and second, to address significant practical implications of this nexus.

The spatial reorganization of the international division of labour has led to \"world cities\", and rural concentration and depopulation, as well as exploitative economic enclaves as endpoints in global commodity chains. The emergence of an increasingly integrated international economic order are associated, in the advanced economies, with a shift from manufacturing, for which automobile production has been the standard example, to a service-dominated economy, ranging from financial services, internet development and movie and music creation, to fast food chains and mass tourism. This industrial transformation has been accompanied by shifts in organizational structures, whether the emphasis has been on increased operational flexibility, or downsizing, one is continuously faced with the impact of new information technologies on the workplace. Does the electronic storage and transmission of information create acceptable efficiencies, or do they represent new methods for controlling and exploiting an increasingly vulnerable workforce, particularly lower-class women and/or immigrants?

Rather than take the categories of 'women's health' and 'men's health' as its foundation, the course revolves around two main questions: (1) how does the field of health and healthcare define and enforce the very categories of 'women' and 'men'?; (2) how does gender, thus defined and enforced, affect the health, healthcare, and health work of those defined as men, women, or other? We will consider these questions by examining particular health topics that have a strongly gendered component, such as sexual health, reproductive health, and disability. Throughout the course, we will explore the theoretical perspectives used in the field; the two-sex model and challenges to it; the gendering of particular health problems and health professions; the medicalization of womanhood and, more recently, manhood; and the relationships between gender and other forms of social classification (e.g. race, class, sexual orientation).

As they travel, migrants negotiate the multiple (sometimes competing) demands of kin, employers, and policies set by more than one state. Because commitments and obligations they experience straddle the borders they have crossed, migrants lives are transnational. their ideas of “home” and identity are also reworked as they travel and can be conflicted as their circumstances change. Some writers have concluded contemporary migration is both turbulent and chaotic compared with historical examples. This course begins with review of some historical migration examples and critically reviews how these differ from current globalization flows.

What and who counts as deviant and how deviance is managed vary dramatically across historical periods, cultures, and regimes of social control. By applying social theories of deviance and normalization to case studies in health, law/crime, and morality, this course encourages students to think more critically about how and why our society responds to difference.
