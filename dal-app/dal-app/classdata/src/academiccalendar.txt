CANA 1102 Halifax and the World: Part I
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course offers an introduction to both International Development Studies and Canadian Studies by exploring the connections between important global issues and your daily life as a student in Halifax. As you walk across the Dalhousie campus and go about daily life in Halifax, your actions connect you to people around the globe and to the history of the city and world as well as to the many works of literature, art and music that depict these connections. Here are just a few examples of connections that we will explore in Halifax and the World: Part I (INTD / CANA 1102.03):▪ Walking across the Dalhousie campus you are traversing what remains unceded Mi'kmaq territory raising hard questions about relations between Settler and First Nations Peoples.▪ While walking downtown on a Friday night you might tread in the footsteps of the central characters in Hugh MacLennan's novel Barometer Rising and other major works of Canadian fiction.▪ As you walk through the city you'll see monuments and statues that commemorate the city's early colonial leaders – which raise questions about how we chose to remember history of the city and its connections to the world.The course will critically examine the connections between daily life in Halifax and broader issues of colonialism, race and class relations, historical memory, ethics and justice through a combination of lectures, guest speakers, discussion groups, field trips, experiential learning in the

This course employs an interdisciplinary approach to focus on selected themes in Canadian history and society. Beginning with the
premise that a nation is fundamentally a “narration,” it asks: What sorts of stories do Canadians tell about themselves? Thus the course is centered on important texts - novels, poems, films, songs, and political documents - that relate formative events in Canadian history and that point to new, sometimes contested, directions for the future. Themes may include, but are not restricted to: First Nation's history and culture; multiculturalism; wilderness; the north; regional identity; and foreign policy.

CANA 2208 Patriots, Rebels, Refugees: Canada’s roots in the Age of Revolution, 1763 to 1860
CREDIT HOURS: 3
As empires continued their international contest and Britain fought to maintain colonies within North America, old and new inhabitants of what would become Canada also wrestled with questions concerning who would exercise power within their communities and governing bodies. In the process they gave new and, at times, conflicting answers to old questions: what did it mean to be a patriot? who and what were they willing to defend? who and what were they prepared to resist? Immigrants, exiles and the refugees of European and North American wars shaped new homelands, even as the First Nations peoples became refugees within their own lands. In this course we explore the related questions of loyalty and conscience through the diaries and letters of men and women defining their place in a new order.

The central tenet of the course is that the history of the Black population is an integral component of the region's history: neither can be understood in isolation from the other. A recurring theme is the active and conscious historical agency of African Nova Scotians in the struggle to assert their democratic rights and achieve self-determination.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
Early Canadian theatre offers a fascinating example of a colonized nation’s struggle to find its own dramatic voice in the face of powerful outside influences.

The course will close with a consideration of the influential Massey Commission and the birth of the Stratford Festival, Canada’s first ‘world class’ theatre. Over the course of the term, special attention will be paid to the development of diverse dramatic traditions in French and English Canada.

CANA 4501 Canadian Theatre Since 1968: Interrogating Identities
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This seminar course will examine the ongoing emergence of uniquely Canadian forms of theatre in the years since the Massey Commission asserted the need to foster Canada’s native talent. Topics to be considered will include: the controversial role of government subsidy and policy-making in Canadian culture; the differing models offered by the Stratford and Shaw Festivals, by the major regional theatres, and by ‘alternate’ and independent companies; the contrast between First Nations, English- and French- Canadian traditions; and the rise of the current ‘Fringe’ phenomenon. Drama by representative playwrights will be considered alongside post-colonial theory and primary sources in Canadian theatre history to help students consider what a genuinely ‘Canadian’ theatre might look like. Above all, the course offers an opportunity to consider the complex relationship between theatre and national identity: who are ‘we,’ and how might our theatre express or even shape ‘us’?

 Introduction
Dalhousie provides ways to study many aspects of Cinema and Media Studies, within the vibrant context of our multi-disciplinary Fountain School of Performing Arts. We offer core courses in film history and audiovisual analysis as well as electives in national cinemas, individual directors, film genres, television, video games, and various kinds of film and media theory. The Cinema and Media Studies program teaches students to think critically about the moving image in its historical, theoretical, and cultural contexts and to appreciate and view audiovisual storytelling media with eyes wide open.
The Bachelor of Arts in Cinema and Media Studies offers focused studies to prepare graduates for careers or further study in many areas, including film, television, digital media, curating, and reviewing, as well as professional programs such as Law and Education. Training in Cinema and Media Studies teaches transferrable analytical, problem-solving, and communications skills that are excellent preparation for many career paths in and beyond the world of moving images.
You can pursue a BA Major, Double Major, or Combined Honours degree in Cinema and Media Studies. Alternatively, you can pursue a BSc if you combine CMS with a Science subject for a Double Major or Combined Honours. Finally, you can complete a Minor in Film Studies, which includes a smaller range of electives than the Cinema and Media Studies program but shares many of the same courses, including the core courses.
The degree programs involve a curriculum of Cinema and Media Studies courses and a selection of other courses in different disciplines. The University has Academic Regulations which specify how these programs must be arranged. These regulations are all listed earlier in this Calendar, and prospective students should refer to them to become aware of the opportunities offered. There are a surprising number of different ways to arrange one’s studies; recommended here are the paths you can follow if Cinema and Media Studies is your primary interest.
Degree Programs
In addition to the Fountain School requirements listed below, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Degree Requirements section of this calendar.
BA with Combined Honours in Cinema and Media Studies
BA (120 credit hour) Major in Cinema and Media Studies
BA (120 credit hour) Double Major in Cinema and Media Studies Minor in Film Studies
BA (120 credit hour) Major in Cinema and Media Studies
The Major in Cinema and Media Studies requires a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 54 credit hours in Cinema and Media Studies beyond the 1000-level. This must include at least 18 credit hours beyond the 2000-level, and within them must be the following required courses:
• FILM 2311.03: Film Analysis or SMU ENGL 2511.03: Reading Film
• FILM 2301.03: Film History 1 or NSCAD AHIS 2800.03: Film History and Criticism 1890-1945
• FILM 3301.03: Film History 2 or NSCAD AHIS 2810.03: Film History and Criticism 1945-Present
In addition to all this, students must follow the general requirements for a BA Major degree.

In principle, no more than 6 credit hours of a student's degree in Cinema & Media Studies may be in film production as opposed to the academic study of cinema, although permission may be granted for a student to include more production courses in their degree if they also complete more than the minimum number of electives. Film production may include Fountain School apprenticeships (depending on the host organization), PERF 3721.03, PERF 3722.03, and includes NSCAD film production courses. If there is a course not currently on the list of pre-approved electives that students would like to take, and/or for permission to include more than 6 credit hours of production courses, contact the Associate Director of Cinema and Media Studies.

As per Dalhousie’s regulations for Combined Honours degrees, grades in these courses must be ‘C” or better, otherwise the course will not count toward the degree. They must include at least 18 credit hours beyond the 2000-level, and within them must be the following required courses:
• FILM 2311.03: Film Analysis or SMU ENGL 2511.03: Reading Film
• FILM 2301.03: Film History 1 or NSCAD AHIS 2800.03: Film History and Criticism 1890-1945

A student in this program may elect to complete the Honours Qualifying Credit in either Cinema and Media Studies or the Combined field. In CMS, the credit is a zero-credit, letter-graded paper with a professionalization component (participation at a colloquium) designed to act as a capstone to the degree by providing an opportunity to plan, conduct, and present independent research.
In addition to all this, students must follow the general requirements for a BA Combined Honours degree.
In principle, no more than 6 credit hours of a student's degree in Cinema & Media Studies may be in film production as opposed to the academic study of cinema, although permission may be granted for a student to include more production courses in their degree if they also complete more than the minimum number of electives. Film production may include Fountain School apprenticeships (depending on the host organization), PERF 3721.03, PERF 3722.03, and includes NSCAD film production courses.

 Introduction
Classics is the study of the ancient Greeks and Romans: their myths, mysteries, and games, their epics, comedies, and tragedies, their languages, arts, and architectures, their religions, philosophies, and sciences. We examine how they constructed their relations to nature, literally created "history", and discovered how terrible the human is. We learn their magic, blessings, and curses, their politics and laws, their social structures, and ways of making war. We look at their sex lives, how they died, and what they used for money. Classics tells the story of the rise and fall of their empires, and of what has indelibly lasted after imperial military and political forces collapsed. We investigate how what the Greeks and Romans became depended on encounters with the peoples, cultures, philosophies, technologies of war and peace, politics and religions of Egypt and North Africa, of Judea, Lebanon, and Syria, of Arabia and Persia, and of Tuscany and the Eurasian North. And Classics looks at how, out of those
 573
 
same meetings, new religions and philosophies evolved, giving us the literatures, arts, and politics of Greek, Latin, and Arabic Christianities, of Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic Judaisms, and of Islam. We start from the remotest origins of human history, make a long stop at the "Classical" period, become what some regard as decadent, and go up to the end of the Middle Ages. We are at home in Athens and Rome, in Constantinople and Istanbul, in Carthage, Alexandria and Jerusalem, in Antioch, Damascus, and Baghdad, in Cordoba and Palermo, in Paris, Oxford, Fribourg, and Cologne, and we encamp at Hadrian's Wall, once the boundary of "civilization". Languages, chiefly Greek and Latin, are both our pleasure and our necessity, but Classics is much more than the study of languages, its study lays the foundation of self-knowledge.
Classics at Dalhousie offers the full range of electives and degree programs: minors, majors, and honours for Bachelor degrees, the Master of Arts, and the PhD. It has specialists in philosophy and religion, in languages and literature, and in history. Students of Classics must learn Greek and Latin, if they wish to take an honours degree or go on to graduate studies in the field. While we recommend that students begin Latin or Greek in their first year, it is quite feasible to start language studies subsequently.

CLAS 2002 Medieval Natural Philosophy: From the Roman Empire to the Age of Dante
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course introduces key developments in medieval understandings of nature (better called "natural philosophy" than "science") through a direct engagement with primary sources. We consider how the texts and authorities of antiquity (Plato and Aristotle, most notably) were assimilated, adapted and transformed during the Roman Empire, in Islam, and in later medieval Christian Europe. Questions such as the role of ‘nature’ in defining human happiness, the good life, and the character of political power will figure prominently. We will attend to the limits of ‘natural’ reason in relation to established disciplines like theology, as well as more contested areas of knowledge such as magic, astrology and alchemy. The approach taken will be that of intellectual history, in the sense that we will focus on fundamental concepts articulated by the authors and on careful textual exegesis, while always attentive to the wider historical and cultural contexts. Especially given that this course's authors, texts and contexts are quite distant in time from our contemporary world, there will also be occasions for us to reflect on the challenges facing the modern inquirer into pre-modern conceptions of nature and scientific knowledge.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
How did a little village conquer the world? This course follows Rome's gradual expansion across Latium, Italy, and finally the whole Mediterranean. Questionable myths, aggressive literature, fiery rhetoric, and political propaganda complement the archaeological record as we trace the development and decadence of Republican institutions and the Republic's descent into shattering civil war. Class tensions, continuous foreign conflict, and still famous figures like Brutus, Cato, Cicero, and Caesar feature prominently in this vigorous study of a paradigmatic political and social problem: the destiny of Republican Rome. Students will be expected to familiarise themselves with both primary and secondary materials, but no knowledge of Latin is required.

CLAS 2232 The Fall of Rome: Caesars, Saints, and Warlords
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Rome did not fall in a day, or even a century. If the period of Imperial power includes Rome's decadence, it also includes its greatest power and glory. In this chronological survey of the Roman Empire, we will trace the rise of autocracy, the causes of rare but ferocious civil wars, and the transformation of Roman political institutions from Augustus to Diocletian. A lively look at the growth of urban life in the West, at the limits of Roman identity throughout the empire, at the fearful economic and military crisis of the 3rd century, at the adoption of official Christianity, and at the challenges of foreign invasion will lead us to ponder whether the "Decline and Fall" model of Roman imperial history is still valid. Students will be expected to familiarise themselves with both primary and secondary materials, but no knowledge of Latin is required. This course is a continuation of the material covered in CLAS 2231 / HIST 2090 but that is not a prerequisite.

CLAS 2281 Christian Beginnings: The Orthodox and Oriental Churches
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course traces the development of Christianity from its origin as a Jewish sect to its status as the dominant religion within the

Byzantine Empire. The Christian religion as patronized by the Eastern Roman Emperors identified itself with the persecuted Christian sect of the first three centuries through the cult of the martyrs, articulated in the increasing importance of relic, icon, and pilgrimage to holy place. The seven ecumenical councils (325-787) progressively defined the Orthodox faith and resulted in the rise of Oriental churches, rejecting aspects of the definitions. Through to our end-date of 843 (when the icon was finally accepted) themes will be treated by attention to historical events (including the rise of Islam), art, architecture, liturgy, and various genres of literature (including hagiography).

One of the most controversial new theories in consciousness studies is actually one of the oldest and most common ideas in the history of philosophy. Panpsychism, the view that mind is a fundamental feature of the physical world, goes back to Thales among the Greeks, and has numerous defenders in Hellenic, Hellenistic, late Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Modern philosophy. This class will begin from a consideration of contemporary arguments for panpsychism in Nagel, Chalmers, and Strawson before turning to explore panpsychist views from Thales to Leibniz.

CLAS 3120 Distilling Nature's Secrets: The Ancient Alchemists
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course explores the scientific and esoteric currents which contributed to the rise of alchemy in the late Ancient World, This 'sacred science' of transmutation was a cultural synthesis of Greek natural philosophy, late pagan mysticism, and Near Eastern metallurgic technologies. The physical processes enacted in the alchemical laboratory - where metals were decomposed, purified ad transformed - were experienced inwardly by the alchemist himself as a spiritual drama of death and resurrection, analogous to the rites of initiation in the mystery cults. Alchemy was thus a form of ritual technology, aimed simultaneously at the purification of self and cosmos. The texts studied in the course range from technical manuals preserved on papyrus, to the highly esoteric and visionary works of the Hermetic philosopher Zosimos (circa 300CE). The relation between these technical and occult dimensions will be of central concern. CALENDAR NOTES:

CLAS 4050 Sappho
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Sappho is simultaneously one of the most famous ancient authors and one of the most problematic. Once acclaimed as the most sublime lyric poet of antiquity, even as the "tenth Muse," she reaches us in only a handful of intact poems (together with numerous fragments); therefore, in this class we will employ the full range of scholarly tools (aesthetic interpretation, historical-literary context, theories of performance, analysis of metre and dialect, papyrology) in attempting to assess both Sappho's mostly lost corpus and her legacy in the modern world.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
In this course, we shall stage an encounter between the two great thinkers - Plato and Heidegger - whose thought has often been thought to mark the ‘beginning’ and the ‘end’ of the Western philosophical tradition. Taking Parmenides’ pregnant insight (“Being and Thinking are the same”) as the poietic site of this encounter, we will ask what it still means to engage in philosophy today.

 Introduction
The world is becoming more diverse and complex, and our assumptions about it are constantly challenged. The Contemporary Studies Program tries to make sense of today’s world as a whole by considering the important writers, thinkers, and artists of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, both on their own terms and in relation to some of the fundamental themes of our time. The annual ‘core’ courses give students a framework for understanding
 617
 
political, scientific, and aesthetic phenomena in the contemporary period. The elective courses focus on various aspects of, and explanations for, these often contradictory contemporary phenomena.

Combined Honours
The Contemporary Studies Program (CSP) offers a Combined Honours BA or BSc program offered jointly by Dalhousie University and the University of King’s College. The other honours subject must be selected from the following list of Dalhousie departments and programs:
In Arts: Canadian Studies; Cinema and Media Studies; Classics; Creative Writing; English; French; Gender and Women's Studies; German; History; International Development Studies; Italian; Law, Justice, and Society; Music; Philosophy; Political Science; Religious Studies; Russian; Sociology and Social Anthropology; Spanish; and Theatre.
In Science: Atmospheric Science, Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Science, Economics, Environmental Science, Mathematics, Microbiology and Immunology, Neuroscience, Physics, Psychology, and Statistics. Contemporary Studies can also be taken in combination with Environment, Sustainability and Society.
Electives may be taken in any of the above-mentioned departments and programs, as well as in the following subjects: Early Modern Studies, and History of Science and Technology. In addition, some professors in the Dalhousie Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences are members of the Contemporary Studies teaching staff and offer courses at King's.
 618
 
All students must meet the general requirements for their degree type as detailed in the Degree Requirements section of this calendar. Students who are eligible to take an honours degree are urged to apply to the Contemporary Studies Program. Because it is an honours program, the quality of work required is higher than that required in a 90 credit hour minor or 120 credit hour major program.
Applications for admission must be made to the Dalhousie department concerned and to the Contemporary Studies Office at King’s on forms available from the Registrar at either Dalhousie or King’s. Students normally enroll in CTMP 2001.03 & CTMP 2002.03 (the first "core" course) in their second year, and apply for the Combined Honours program in either second or third year. For each individual student the entire degree program, including elective courses, is subject to supervision and approval by the Dalhousie department concerned and by the Director of Contemporary Studies.
All Contemporary Studies Program students are encouraged to acquire competence in languages through appropriate courses which are relevant to their degree, interests, and future plans.
The joint Dalhousie/King’s Contemporary Studies program is based on the general requirement that the 120 credit hours required to graduate include:
1. Completion of either the King’s Foundation Year Program or at least 12 credit hours of first year courses at Dalhousie:
2. A minimum of 66 and a maximum of 84 credit hours beyond the 1000-level in the two honours subjects, but not more than 48 nor fewer than 30 credit hours being in either of them.
3. The three "core" course doublets in Contemporary Studies: CTMP 2001.03& CTMP 2002.03 (or CTMP 2000.06), CTMP 3001.03 & CTMP 3002.03 (or CTMP 3000.06), CTMP 4001.03 & CTMP 4002.03 (or CTMP 4000.06).
4. Students can elect to take one 3-credit hour approved selective course from other Arts & Social Sciences departments towards the CSP program. The approved list of selectives is:
1. ENGL 2070.03 African American Literature
2. ENGL 3086.03 Post-Colonial Literatures
3. HIST 3380.03 Slavery and Freedom in the Americas
4. INDG 3400.03 Contemporary Indigenous Art
5. INDG 3401.03 Indigenous Representation in Film
6. POLI 2450.03 Democracy, Difference and Citizenship: A Survey of Political Philosophy
7. POLI 2520.03 World Politics
8. POLI 3385.03 Politics of the Environment
9. SOSA 3215.03 Migration and Identity
10. SOSA 3225.03 Culture, Rights and Power
5. At the conclusion of an honours program a student’s record must show a grade which is additional to the grades taken to complete the required 120 credit hours. In a combined honours program, students usually obtain this grade in their primary subject (in which they have completed more credits); permission may be required from the primary subject advisor if a student wishes to obtain the grade in the secondary subject. Students fulfilling this requirement in Contemporary Studies submit a research paper and defend it at an oral examination. They must enroll in the non-credit CTMP 0456.00/CTMP 0457.00, the Honours Thesis Seminar.
Please Note:
Students may take an Independent Readings course only when they reach their third or fourth year. The permission of a member of the teaching staff and the Director is necessary in order to take these courses, and their availability is strictly limited.

What does pain mean? This course will investigate the question of suffering in the contemporary world, and in doing so, it will approach various sites where pain matters, examining different discursive practices which attempt to speak of pain - or alternatively, claim that pain is what cannot be spoken. We will discuss the experience of the body in pain and the relation of pain to knowledge. Topics to be addressed will include pain in a medical context; torture and the political uses of pain; sexuality and pain; the expressibility of pain. We will examine two archetypes of “the tortured artist”, Frida Kahlo and Jackson Pollock, and will inquire whether pain can be made meaningful.

Starting from Lyotard's characterization of the post-modern as an incredulity towards meta- narratives, the course will look at literary narratives (for example, Balzac, Borges, Thomas Pynchon and Alice Munroe) as well as theories of the narrative (Levi-Strauss, Freud, Lacan, Lyotard, and Roland Barthes). Topics to be considered include the constitution of

Since the emergence of vampire stories in the late sixteenth century, the vampire has served as a complex symbol for forces that defy or challenge modernity. This course will examine the figure of the vampire as it appear in folklore, philosophy, fiction, poetry, film, and television. Throughout the course we will consider the works in their historical and cultural context, considering what changing ideas of the vampire can tell us about early modern and contemporary views of death, morality, national identify, sexuality, and gender.

The texts in this course consist of literary and philosophical reflections on death, the "permanent and irreversible cessation of life" (J.M. Fischer). With references to Plato and Hegel, we will consider the ways in which death has been understood as giving meaning
 625
 
and structure to life. The focus will be on contemporary confrontations with "pure negativity" and on different thinkers' attempts to articulate death as an ontological condition. We will also look at representations of death in contemporary art, literature, and film. CALENDAR NOTES:

A preoccupation of 20th century cultural life has been the relation between the creative artist and society. To what extent should the artist engage in the social and political currents of her/his time, or retreat into solitude? What responsibility does the artist have to society, or society to the artist? This course often concentrates on a particular artist or group of artists. In 2017-18, the artist will be David Bowie.

We will read representative texts, including prose, poetry, drama, and manifestos as well as examine selected works from the visual arts and film. Topics for discussion include the historical Avant-Garde, the reintegration of art and life, the relations of the Avant-Garde to romanticism and modernism, the institution of art, aesthetics, the autonomy of art, and political radicalism. We will also examine the implications of theories of the Avant-Garde for the debates about the relation between modernism and postmodernism. A key theoretical text in the course is Peter Burger's Theory of the Avant-Garde but we will also examine selected writings by Lukacs, Brecht, Benjamin, Kracauer, Poggioli, Adorno, Bataille, Habermas, Lyotard, and Agamben.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This class engages one of the main questions of our modern world: what is science and how does it relate to the rest of modernity? It explores the rise of a “scientific” world view, the clashes over methodologies, the disputed meanings of technology and the oppositions between the social/cultural and the natural, introducing recent crises of rationality and its defence.

CTMP 3101 Crisis of Critique of Reason
 627
 
CREDIT HOURS: 3
There is a tendency, widespread in our day, to deny that we can know with certainty the conditions of any claim to knowledge, and as a result to doubt that we can say anything true about the world and ourselves. This class reconstructs the history of this critique of reason with a view to understanding the profound changes that have overtaken the social disciplines in the course of the past few decades. The class spans a couple of centuries. We discuss amongst other things the relationship between scepticism and truth, the practical character of human rationality, and the role of the language in the formation of our scientific theories, our ethical and political thinking, and our aesthetic sensibilities.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
Nothing generates more controversy in our intellectual world than questions concerning the interpretation of history and culture. To what extent should interpretation be negative or critical? How are critical ideas contained in traditional practices and beliefs? In this class we explore the antagonism between tradition and critique. Starting from two opposed theories of interpretation - "deconstruction" (Derrida) and the "historicity of understanding" (Gadamer) - the class proceeds in a historically-oriented way to study, on the one hand, the philosophical traditions of idealism, Marxism, and hermeneutics and, on the other hand, psychoanalysis and literary criticism. We discuss amongst other things the distinction between myth and science, the notion of "progress" in history, and the sources of understanding.

What is the status of the modern world? It is a source of freedom and truth or rather of the deconstruction of religion, humanity and nature. The contemporary period has defined itself in many ways through the critique of modernity. These critiques have come from an array of perspectives: philosophic, aesthetic, religious, moral, political. This course will provide a survey of a number of such critiques seeking to grasp both points of commonality, disagreement and development.

CTMP 3110 The Ideal World of Enlightenment: Desire and Freedom
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In the course of criticizing tradition and integrating the experience of the Renaissance and the Reformation, in responding to the beginnings of modern natural science and modern political institutions, early modern Europeans sought in diverse - and often conflicting - ways to express the self-understanding of Enlightenment. By the end of the eighteenth century, science, morality and art were seen as different realms of activity in which questions of truth, justice and taste could be separately determined, that is, evaluated according to their own specific criteria of validity. This course will consider how these differences compelled European philosophers and theologians, artists and social theorists, to develop and expand their self-understanding to the point where enlightened reason could properly reflect the formal divisions of culture and make critical judgements in relation to them. Special attention will be paid to the relationship between faith and knowledge and the growing sense of conflict between religion and secular freedom.

This course will examine the roots of the modern conception of radical evil in the late work of Immanuel Kant. Beginning with the traditional, pre-Kantian conception of evil as merely a negative phenomenon - as a lack or privation of being - we will trace the emergence of Kant's radical innovation, his positive conception of evil as the ineradicable "knot" at the very heart of human freedom. We will also consider at some length the subsequent career of Kant's doctrine in 19th and 20th Century thought.

CTMP 3115 The Real World of Enlightenment: Time and History
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In enlightened European culture, religion, state and society as well as science, morality and art were gradually separated from one another under exclusively formal points of view, and subordinated to a critical reason that took on the role of a supreme judge. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, many Europeans began to question the self-understanding evoked by the principle of critical
 629
 
reason. This course will consider how enlightened freedom and reason moved European philosophers and theologians, artists and social theorists, to conceive of themselves historically, that is, to become conscious of the dissolution of tradition, and of the need to ground the divisions of culture in ideal forms of unity derived from the tradition. The course will pay particular attention to the relationship between religion and the demand that the unifying force in culture come from a dialectic residing in the principle of enlightened reason itself.

This course is an inquiry into the concept of genocide, which takes into account its cultural, socio-political and historical contexts. Which atrocities are included in that concept and why? What is the relation between “genocide” and “human rights”? Does the fact that the term was coined in a specific context (after WWII) limit its applicability to non-European phenomena, both prior to and after the war? We will consider several documented instances of genocidal violence and reflect on the relations between genocide and the politics of memory, including museum displays, public commemorations, and popular culture. We will look at competing claims from victim groups and ask questions about the impact of racism in targeting specific populations; gender difference in the experience of atrocity; and the role of world powers in deciding about intervention or non-intervention.

CTMP 3130 The Thought of Michel Foucault
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The thought of Michel Foucault (1926-1984) resists categorization. This is in large part due to its interdisciplinary nature, which crosses the boundaries of history, sociology, psychology and philosophy. This class will introduce students to some of the topics in Foucault’s major works on the history of madness, the birth of the penitentiary, the history of the human sciences, bio-power, the history of sexuality, and ethics. Readings will include selections from Foucault’s major published works as well as interviews, lectures, and shorter essays. We will pay particular attention to the evolution of Foucault’s methodology from archaeology to genealogy and Foucault’s later claim that the goal of his work from the 1960s to 1980s has been the creation of a history of the different ways in which human beings are made subjects.

CTMP 3135 Reconstructing Political Modernity
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course will examine several interpretations of early modern philosophers by 20th century authors who are original political thinkers in their own right. These interpretations have involved as much reconstruction of early modern thought as faithful scholarly commentary. Indeed, they sometimes shed more light on the interpreter than the thinkers being interpreted. Thus, we shall critically analyze the radical transformations of early modern texts that were undertaken in order to make these works relevant to social and political questions centuries later.

CTMP 3145 Leo Strauss and his Intellectual Context
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Leo Strauss was during his own lifetime a figure of controversy and has grown more so in the thirty years since his death. In recent newspaper and academic articles, Strauss has been seen through the influence of his students ("Straussians") to be the secret intellectual source of much of the Neo-Conservative movement and in particular the policies and doctrines of the Bush White House. This course will endeavour to understand Strauss's thought in terms of his own intellectual development and in the context of the issues that were particularly formative for his thinking. The course will include the influence of Husserl upon his thought, his reflections on Zionism and the Jewish intellectual tradition during the 1920s and 30s when he was still living in Germany, his critique of Carl Schmitt, his response to the thought of Martin Heidegger, his debate with Alexandre Kojeve. In short, the purpose of this course is to locate Strauss's thought in its intellectual context and thereby gain distance on the demonizing and sanctifying rhetoric that characterizes the contemporary debate about "Straussianism".

CTMP 3192 The Thought of Ludwig Wittgenstein

Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) is one of the most renowned philosophers of the twentieth century. His extraordinary influence is the result of his teaching small groups of dedicated students. Published for the most part posthumously, his writings, too, have made him a philosopher's philosopher. Nevertheless, his influence has extended well beyond the questions about the foundations of logic and language which preoccupied him. This course will explore some of the broader implications of his work, touching on music, art and architecture, on anthropology and psychology, and on ethics and religion, as well as on his central contributions to the philosophy of language and mind.

CTMP 3201 Science and Religion: Contemporary Perspectives
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Beginning with an overview of the history and methodology of the study of science and religion, encounters between science and religion are traced from the rise of Darwinism in the early nineteenth century to the contemporary postmodern age. From an examination of nineteenth-century “Scriptural geology” and the religious impact of Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859), this course moves on to such contemporary topics as the religious interpretations of quantum mechanics, the Big Bang, the anthropic principle, medical science, bioethics, evolutionary psychology, chaos theory, aesthetics in nature, science fiction, extra-terrestrial life (including the SETI Project) and the quest for technoimmortality. Case studies of “conflict” emanating from Darwinism, the Scopes Trial, the on- going Creation-Evolution debates and the New Atheism are contrasted with examples of harmony and interdependence between science and religion in the careers of modern scientists, along with phenomena like the new Intelligent Design (ID) movement. The religious scope of the course in intentionally wide-ranging, and examinations of science-religion interaction within Native American, African, and New Age spirituality are added to treatments of traditional eastern and western religion.

CTMP 3210 Intersecting Bodies, Selves and Environments
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The traditional view of the relation between humans and nonhuman nature is regarded by many as dualistic insofar as it posits not only a distinction and separation between humans and nonhuman nature but regards humans as superior to nonhuman nature, on either religious, metaphysical, moral, or even evolutionary, grounds. In this course, we examine three different strategies for overcoming this view. We begin by examining phenomenological attempts to overcome dualistic accounts of the relations between perceiver and perceived, mind and body, and mind and world. In the next section, we discuss attempts by radical ecologists to establish a nondualist view of the relation between humans and nature. In the concluding section of the course, we examine some postmodern strategies for overcoming dualistic thinking about culture and nature.

Is there such a thing as value-free scientific research? How do feminist theories of knowledge differ from traditional understandings of scientific knowledge and scientific objectivity? The readings for this course will include work by Donna Haraway, Sandra Harding, Evelyn Fox Keller, Helen Longino, and Hilary Rose.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
At the time when the Holocaust recedes into history, the imperative to “never forget” acquires new urgency. In this course, we focus on various modes of talking about this traumatic historical period. Why did the Holocaust happen “in the middle of civilized Europe”? Who were the perpetrators? Does the word “Holocaust” refer only to the Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jewish people or should we also consider the experiences of different victim groups (e.g., the disabled, gay people, and the Roma people)? Did men and women experience the events differently because of their biological gender and social gender norms at the time? Can horror be accommodated in language or represented by any other means? Is the Holocaust unique or should it be considered in comparison with other genocides? These and other questions will arise in this class from the examination of eye-witness accounts from the killing fields in the East, Holocaust diaries written in the ghettoes, memoirs written by survivors of the Nazi camps, and perpetrators’ diaries, as well as works by historians and literary works written by the participants of the events.

CTMP 3340 Home and Homelessness
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course takes the current social problem of homelessness as a starting place for an inquiry into the significance of figurations of home and homelessness in the contemporary world. Home is a place of comfort and belonging; it is a domestic setting, a language, a nationality and a series of identifications that ‘place’ and maintain individuals. The notion of home is opposed to key diagnoses of the modern condition--as alienated, displaced, estranged and uncanny, for example. These diagnoses have been applied both to psychological conditions and to actual social phenomena of mass displacements, refugees, immigration and exile. The social imaginary of many historically displaced groups centres around the return to or establishment of a homeland.This course will consider literary and artistic representations of ‘home’, the phenomenology of ‘homeliness’ and of its strange double, the uncanny, and the stakes that post-war philosophy has in the notions of rootedness, place and dwelling.

CTMP 3345 The Theory of the Gift
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Is it possible to give, freely, without expectation of return? That is, can generosity ever really exist? Or are we trapped in restricted economies of exchange which find us always calculating some profit to ourselves, whether in this world or the next? The problem of the possibility of generosity and altruism is of central importance to current deliberations about ethics and economics. This seminar will read its way through the modern genealogy of the thinking of the gift, beginning with its foundation in anthropological studies of so-called 'primitive' economies. It is of some interest that the modern concern with the gift appears in the guise of anthropology rather than from its well-established place in the Christian theological tradition. This course will consider the debate over the gift among anthropologists such as Mary Douglas and Marshall Sahlins, in the extraordinary theses of Georges Bataille, and will place special emphasis on the importance of the gift in the work of Jacques Derrida.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This class dissects the dominant, binary (male/female) notion of gender, as it has been constructed in relation to heteropatriarchal
norms and systems of signification. We look at the dissolution of these rigid concepts and consider alternative (and multiple) sites of gender-identification through the lens of gender theory, fictional works (novels and poetry), and visual material (art, film, and music). We ask in what way these gendered subversions of traditional discourses engage (or fail to engage) the intersections of gender with race, sexuality, class, ability and other identity categories.

Taught entirely on site, this course offers students the opportunity to consider the ethical, aesthetic, and public struggle to memorialize the victims of Nazi fascism and Cold War Stalinism through daily visits to museums and public art installations, as well as more informal explorations of memorial initiatives ‘from below.’

CTMP 4001 The Deconstruction of the Tradition I
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This class focuses on deconstruction as a philosophical movement which aims to challenge totalizing models of thinking in favor of
forms of discourse that can accommodate pluralism and alterity. The ‘linguistic turn’ – so important for deconstruction - foregrounds the promise and limits of language, and invites inquiry into its epistemic, ethical, political, and cultural determinations.

CTMP 4002 The Deconstruction of the Tradition II
CREDIT HOURS: 3
While the main practitioners of deconstruction sought to interrogate traditional concepts of identity, selfhood, representation, truth, essence, and origin, their own writings are not free of epistemic – and even ontological – violence. We will re-examine these texts through the lens of post-colonial, feminist, and race theory, and inquire into the continuing value of deconstruction in the contemporary world.

CTMP 4105 European Nihilism
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In the latter half of the nineteenth-century a number of European thinkers and writers came to sense a profound loss of meaning and significance at work in their culture. The term that was coined to describe this experience was "nihilism." The purpose of this course is to explore the thought of those who gave expression to this new phenomenon. We will begin with the literary explorations of Dostoyevsky and Baudelaire, and then turn to the thought of Nietzsche as the most complete explication of European nihilism. The course will conclude by considering the twentieth-century's most important commentator on nihilism, Martin Heidegger. In particular, the course will consider Martin Heidegger's set of lectures from the late 1930s that were published as Nietzsche. This set of lectures as reflections on Nietzsche's account of European nihilism formed, according to Heidegger's own recounting, a crucial transition in his own thought, the famous "turn" from the "early" to the "late" Heidegger. This course will examine the lecture series in the context of
 638
 
Heidegger's other writings at this time and his much-debated involvement with Nazism to try to understand the exact nature and import of his "turn." In all of this the course will be exploring the connections between a deep cultural experience - that of European nihilism and its social and political implications.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course explores the current preoccupation with ruins in two ways: first, we shall establish lines of continuity between older forms of the pleasure of ruins (Ruinenlust) from the Renaissance to Romanticism. Second, we shall consider what characterizes the contemporary admiration for decrepitude and decay: We will consider modern and contemporary examples of ruins, wreckage, and decay to highlight a critical blurring of boundaries, in the ruin, between the present, past, and future; between presence and absence; between nature and history; between destruction and disclosure.

In this course, we shall stage an encounter between the two great thinkers - Plato and Heidegger - whose thought has often been thought to mark the ‘beginning’ and the ‘end’ of the Western philosophical tradition. Taking Parmenides’ pregnant insight (“Being and Thinking are the same”) as the poietic site of this encounter, we will ask what it still means to engage in philosophy today.

CTMP 4125 Hannah Arendt: Terror, Politics, Thought
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In this course we examine the trajectory of Hannah Arendt's long path of thinking: from her early political writings (on the state of Israel, on totalitarianism), to the more theoretically ambitious writings of the 1950's and 1960's (on action, power, and the creation of political spaces), to the late work on the life of the mind (on thinking, willing, and judging). We will attempt to understand how Arendt's overarching 'love of the world' informed her thought at every stage of its development, giving rise to a powerful critique of liberal democracy and preparing the groundwork for a new 'post-totalitarian' thinking of the political.

This course examines some of the major figures in the phenomenological movement. We begin with an examination of Edmund Husserl's attempt to establish a "radical" science of phenomenology. The method of phenomenology, the intentionality of consciousness, perception, and the Lebenswelt are among the topics we will consider. We then turn to various reformulations and critiques of Husserl's conception of Phenomenology in selected works from Heidegger to Derrida. Topics and concepts for discussion will include Being-in-the-world, the nature of consciousness, the lived body, temporality, the priority of otherness and hermeneutics. CALENDAR NOTES:

CTMP 4200 Philosophies of Technology: From Techne to Technology
CREDIT HOURS: 3
What does it mean to live in a “technological society”? In a certain sense, technology forms the very ground of what it means to be “modern”. We moderns are technological beings. This course will explore the history, structure and associated problems of our coming to be technological, beginning with technical arts and instrumental reasoning of Enlightenment and industrial ideology. Post- Enlightenment critiques polarizing around the place of “machine” and alienation in Karl Marx, and in the “question concerning technology” in Martin Heidegger will then be examined, leading up to the present state of technological discourse. In each case, we shall mark the importance of contextualising the debate by examining the actual historical evolution of technology. Weekly lectures will be devoted to presenting a social and historical background to the development of modern technologies. Student-led seminars will focus on the reading of primary texts in the field.

Can there be a philosophy of technology? What are the political and cultural ramifications of going technological? Topics will include: technological determinism in history, feminist critiques, technology and development, the meaning of expertise, technology, art and the “lifeworld”, social-construction vs. actor-network theory, Donna Haraway's concept of cyborg culture and the “modern technological sublime”. The course will be conducted in seminar format with particular emphasis placed on the elucidation of historical and contemporary case-studies.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
Is psychoanalysis a medical practice, a method of interpretation, or an account of the social symbolic? The modern skepticism about

consciousness and conscious life is most thoroughly voiced in psychoanalytic thought as first developed by Freud and pursued in the work of Jacques Lacan. This course will consider the question of the modern psyche, the nature of symbolic practices in art and literature, and the construction of libidinal economies in society. The central question of the course will concern the way in which the individual subject is incorporated in symbolic practices. The recent attacks on Freud and Freudian methodologies will also be considered.

Freudian psychoanalysis and its Lacanian successor have added new dimensions to the analysis of contemporary political issues. In the mid-twentieth century Sigmund Freud’s theory of the unconscious was drawn upon to supplement liberal and Marxist analyses of fascism. Lacanian psychoanalysis has recently been employed in the understanding of nationalism, ethnic conflict and religious fundamentalism through such categories as identification, recognition and trauma. The course will begin with some key texts by Freud and Lacan, and then move to a consideration of recent examples of the conjunction of psychoanalytic and political theory.

CTMP 4330 Ethics after the Holocaust
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Shortly after World War II ended, thinkers such as Arendt, Adorno, and Buber reflected on the causes of the genocide and its impact on humanity. It has taken decades, however, for others (such as Fackenheim, Habermas or Derrida) to confront "Auschwitz." In this course, we will inquire into the challenges the Holocaust poses to philosophy, and to ethics in particular. The thinkers discussed reflect on the collapse of traditional ethical systems in the wake of National Socialism. In various ways and in different religious and cultural contexts, they try to find an alternative moral foundation "after Auschwitz".

Coordinated Arts Program (DalCAP)
Coordinated Arts Program (DalCAP)
Dalhousie offers the widest range of courses and programs in the arts, humanities, and social sciences of any university in the Maritimes. We have dozens of first year courses to let you tailor your studies specifically to your interests. BA students can also choose courses from Science, Management, Computer Science, and from the neighbouring University of King’s College to further diversify their studies. Or, instead of picking your own set of courses, starting in the 2017/18 academic year, you might wish to start your time at Dal with our new intensive, interdisciplinary, coordinated year one program: the DalCAP.
This coordinated, structured set of courses will give you the foundation for engaging with the challenges facing our world, even as it provides an excellent entry point for most Majors in the Arts and Social Sciences*. Still a full courseload, 30 credit hours program but with only three courses per term instead of the usual five, DalCAP lets you focus your attention – and will have coordinated assignment deadlines, too. You’ll work throughout the year with a group of students in the same program, benefiting from a community of people with similar interests in a mix of lectures and small discussion groups. The DalCAP is intended to ease first year students’ transitions to university by helping to create learning communities and simplifying course selection, even as it challenges participants to learn new skills and knowledge that will help them excel in a wide range of fields thereafter.
As a DalCAP student you’ll take: Fall term:
• SUST 1000.06: Introduction to Environment, Sustainability and Society 1
• CRWR 1030/ENGL 1030.06: Reading and Writing Stories
• plus one course of your choice (3 credit hours)
Winter term:
• POLI 1500.06: Globalizations (Political Science, Sociology, and Social Anthropology)
• HIST 1510.06: The History of the Future
• plus one course of your choice (3 credit hours)
 644
 
* Note: For language majors (i.e., French, German, Spanish, and Russian), add the relevant intro course as your optional course. Students intending to major in Philosophy are encouraged (but not required) to add an intro Philosophy course. The DalCAP program isn’t suitable as a first year for Music or Theatre students. Note that the DalCAP program satisfies four of the five distribution requirements for BA students: it covers the Science, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Writing requirements, leaving only the language requirement to be fulfilled with either the optional course or in a later year.

 Introduction
What are the bases of our modern conceptions of the self, nature, society, freedom, and art? What ideas provoked historical turning-points such as the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution? These questions, as well as those surrounding atheism, witchcraft, maritime piracy, cross-cultural encounters, the fine arts, vampirism, and more were set in motion in the early modern period. Thinkers and artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Machiavelli, Shakespeare, Descartes, Hobbes, Rousseau, Goethe, and Wollstonecraft sparked the conversations we are still having centuries later.
The Early Modern Studies Program (EMSP) explores the origins of modernity through a study of its development in European culture from the 16th to early 19th centuries. We take an interdisciplinary look at an era that begins with the colonization of “new worlds”, and ends with revolutions which made the modern world. By examining
 647
 
philosophical, scientific, moral, social, political, and aesthetic points of view, we gain insight into a time of spectacular upheaval, and understand the revolutionary basis for aspects of society that seem fundamental to contemporary life.
EMSP courses are designed so that important figures and developments may be considered on their own terms and in relation to other important aspects of the period. This will often involve consideration of the differences between the early modern and other historical periods of the west. Emphasis will be placed upon encounters between European and non-European peoples and cultures in the early modern period. Our three “core” courses (mandatory for the Combined Honours degree) cover the key ideas, figures, and developments in early modern culture. Our electives branch out to explore a wide range of topics and questions. Many of these courses pursue in greater depth questions introduced in the core courses.
Aside from preparing undergraduates for more specialized training at the graduate or professional level, the EMSP is intended to provide them with a broad overview of the early modern period. Students are encouraged to relate the various aspects of early modern thought and culture to one another and to develop independent insights into the nature of this historical period. It is also hoped that EMSP students will take an active role in organizing events each year, including lectures, debates, and exhibitions.

Combined Honours
The Combined Honours BA/BSc programs in Early Modern Studies are offered jointly by Dalhousie University and the University of King's College.
The departmental offerings within the EMSP at Dalhousie may include the other honours subject and a number of possible electives. The other honours subject must be selected from the following list of Dalhousie departments and programs: Canadian Studies, Cinema and Media Studies, Classics, Creative Writing, English, French, Gender and Women’s Studies, German, History, International Development Studies, Italian Studies, Law, Justice and Society, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, Religious Studies, Russian Studies, Sociology and Social Anthropology, Spanish, Theatre or any of the BSc Honours subjects. Early Modern Studies can also be taken in combination with Environment, Sustainability and Society. Electives may be taken in any of the above-mentioned departments and programs as well as in the following subjects: Contemporary Studies and History of Science and Technology. In addition, some professors in the Dalhousie Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences are members of the Early Modern Studies teaching staff and offer courses at King's.
Students who are eligible to take an honours degree should apply to the EMSP and the other department or program concerned as early as possible. All students must meet the requirements of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences or the Faculty of Science as detailed in the Degree Requirements section. Because it is an honours
  648
 
program, the quality of work required in it is higher than that required in a 90 credit hour minor or 120 credit hour major program.
Applications for admission must be made to the Dalhousie department concerned and to the Early Modern Studies office at King’s on forms available from the Registrar at either Dalhousie or King’s. Students normally enroll in EMSP 2001.03 & EMSP 2002.03 (or EMSP 2000.06) (the first "core" course) in their second year, and register for the Combined Honours program in either their second or third year. For each individual student, the entire degree program, including elective courses, is subject to supervision and approval by the Dalhousie department concerned and by the Director of Early Modern Studies.
All EMSP students are encouraged to acquire competence in languages through appropriate courses which are relevant to their degree, interests, and future plans.
The joint Dalhousie/King’s Early Modern Studies Program is based on the general requirement that the 120 credit hours needed to graduate include:
1. Completion of either the King’s Foundation Year Program (either the three or the four credit version) or at least 12 credit hours of first year courses.
2. A minimum of 66, maximum of 84 credit hours beyond the 1000 level in the two honours subjects, not more than 48 credit hours being in either of them. Typically, no fewer than 30 credit hours can be completed in either of the honours subjects, but if Early Modern Studies is the secondary subject in a Combined Honours Bachelor of Arts Degree, students may elect to complete a minimum of 24 credit hours in Early Modern Studies courses.
3. The three ‘core’ course doublets in Early Modern Studies:
• EMSP 2001.03 & EMSP 2002.03 (or EMSP 2000.06)
• EMSP 3001.03 & EMSP 3002.03 (or EMSP 3000.06)
• EMSP 4001.03 & EMSP 4002.03 (or EMSP 4000.06)
4. Students can elect to take one 3-credit hour approved selective course from other Arts & Social Sciences departments towards the EMSP program. The approved list of selectives is:
• ENGL 3011.03 Renaissance Poetry and Culture II: Donne to Milton
• ENGL 3015.03 Renaissance Drama
• FREN 3400.03 Love and Death (French Prose & Poetry)

Course Descriptions
EMSP 2001 Structures of the Modern Self I
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Central to what distinguishes modernity from the ages preceding it was the development of a new conception of the self. This course traces the history of the modern self in its European cultural expressions. We will begin in the Renaissance, considering genres such as the novel and essay, and how these express new conceptions of the self. We will also examine crucial early modern developments such as the colonization of the New World, the rise of Protestantism, and the Counter-Reformation, through the lenses of philosophy, literature, and other aesthetic expressions.

EMSP 2002 Structures of the Modern Self II
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course continues exploring the development of the modern self in its European cultural expressions, primarily focusing on philosophical and literary texts from the Enlightenment to early developments in Romanticism. We will grapple with early modern ethical theories and the problem of evil. We will also examine the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment’s emphasis on reason, and the championing of emotion as a more authentic expression of the self. We will continue to examine the novel as a genre and consider portraiture as an expression of the modern self.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course examines the key monuments of Baroque art and architecture and the social and political context in which they were produced. The course begins in the 1560s, a decade that saw the death of Michelangelo, the end of the Council of Trent, and the publication of the second edition of Giorgio Vasari’s Lives of the Artists.

Reformation sets the ground for the 17th century reform of art spurred on by Caravaggio and the Carracci. Their legacy—and the themes of violence and wonder—will be traced through the work of the Caravaggisti and the illusionistic Baroque ceiling painters. The importance of Rome as a locus of Baroque art will be a central focus, but the course also considers the distinctive political, religious, and cultural life of Flanders, the Dutch Republic, Spain, and France.

EMSP 2230 Picture and Poetry in Early Modern Culture
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Early modern artists and thinkers were fond of the Latin phrase, ut pictura poesis, which means, “as in painting, so in poetry.” Ben Jonson, for example, argued that “poetry and picture are arts of a like nature, and both are busy about imitation.” The objective here will be to test the validity of such claims with reference to early modern visual art and literature. Are poets and painters engaged in the same field of representation? Do they adopt parallel strategies of representation? Do they interpret and organize social energies in similar ways?

EMSP 2240 Themes in Early Modern Science, Metaphysics, and Epistemology
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course covers the period from Descartes through Kant and is structured around a study of themes in science, epistemology, and metaphysics as they evolved in this period. Although the themes to be covered may vary somewhat, on the philosophical side the main ones will be a selection from the following: theories of representation, theories of perception, theories of concepts and abstract ideas, theories of knowledge and the issue of skepticism (proofs of God and of the external world), metaphysics and ontology, causality, and doctrines of logic and method. What makes the early modern period so intellectually fascinating is that philosophy and science, empirical studies and a priori studies, are interwoven. We shall look at some parts of the tapestries that resulted, especially in the area of cognitive science, especially in Descartes, but also including physics and mathematics, and the contributions of other philosophers of the period.

EMSP 2250 The Myth of Modernity in Goethe's Faust
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The Faust myth can be described as the myth of modernity itself: the ideas of human self-realization and progress are under debate in the story of the German scholar Dr. Faustus, who in his pact with the devil transgresses the boundaries that nature, religion, and society imposed on mankind. Unquestionably, the most famous representation of this modern myth is Goethe’s Faust. Written over a period of sixty years (1772–1832), Goethe’s opus magnum broadens the focus of the original myth to portray the central ambiguities and controversies presented by the modern age. His Faust is the story of modern man at large, successful, egotistical, torn, alienated, driven, in search of truth and totality, a man who in the course of his life becomes spectacularly guilty, and in the end is spectacularly (and controversially) redeemed. Faust’s journey through the world traces major developments of the western world from the sixteenth to the early nineteenth century, developments that still shape today’s world.

This course explores the range, depth and commitment of the work of several leading figures of the eighteenth-century intellectual movement that came to be known as Les Lumières in France, the Enlightenment in Scotland, Aufklärung in Germany, and Illuminismo in Italy. The course takes a primary interest in the French philosophes, writers, and thinkers who contributed directly to the Encyclopédie, but some consideration will also be given to the movement in these other European countries. Course readings will include a nucleus of articles from the Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire Raisonné des Sciences, des Arts et des Metiers, whose publication was overseen by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert from 1751-1772, augmented by a host of other works of major philosophical, scientific, aesthetic, cultural, and historical importance.

EMSP 2270 Endless Romance
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The great medieval genre of romance both endured and metamorphosed in the early modern period. This course will consider the important transformation of romance in the period by concentrating on two main texts, Spenser's The Faerie Queene, and Cervantes' Don Quixote. The course will begin by looking at a few paradigmatic late medieval romances of the fifteenth century, including portions of Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur, and the Spanish romance by Martorel, Tirant lo blanc. The main texts will then be considered as examples of the extraordinary reception of the genre, as continuation, elaboration and allegorization in the case of Spenser, and as the foundation of the novel in the case of Cervantes. Central themes such as quest, errancy, and desire will be considered; there will be a limited number of readings on the theory of romance (Frye, Bakhtin, Parker). In conclusion, we will briefly consider much later manifestations of romance, in the work of the romantic poets.

Genuine feeling and political liberation are enhanced by attention to classical antiquity and modern folktale. Apparently a reaction against the modern, from Goethe to Hegel, Romanticism manages to eclipse almost everything else. CALENDAR NOTES:

EMSP 2310 Women and Gender in Early Modern Science
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course will explore the roles of women, and questions about women’s nature, in the development of early modern science. The course will consider several interrelated aspects of scientific culture in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries: first, we will look at the place of women in the scientific institutions of the time. The second part of the course will look at the contributions of some particular women to the fields of physics, astronomy, botany, and medicine. We will then examine how science interpreted sex and gender. Finally, the course will explore the ways in which gender and nature were portrayed in the broader cultural context. We will, for example, discuss the ways in which women were depicted as scientists and as symbols of science in art and literature. CALENDAR NOTES:

The period of European history from 1500 to 1800 saw the rise of modern science and philosophy. It was also a period in which thousands of witch trials and executions were carried out. This course will seek to understand how these seemingly contradictory developments could have occurred simultaneously. The course will examine changing conceptions of the witch and witchcraft in their historical, intellectual, cultural, religious, and political contexts. We will pay special attention to early modern notions of gender and sexuality and their influence on the witch hunts and witch trials.

EMSP 2330 Nature Imagined: Literature and Science in Early Modern Europe
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries brought about massive changes in the scientific world view. These changes also had a great influence on the literature of the period. Some writers were entranced by the new natural science, and sought to disseminate its principles and lionize its most significant figures. Other writers were harshly critical of the emerging notions of scientific progress and domination of nature. This course will examine the ways in which science was portrayed in early modern poetry, prose, and drama, in an attempt to understand how the new science, and new conceptions of nature, were understood and received in the broader philosophical and cultural context.

EMSP 2340 The Origins of Science Fiction in Early Modern Europe
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In 1500, literate Europeans lived in a bounded, geocentric universe. By 1800, the sun had replaced the earth at the centre of a limited planetary system situated in infinite space. These changes prompted early modern philosophers, scientists, and writers to consider the possibility that the universe might contain a plurality of worlds. This course will explore the ways in which the “plurality” theme was developed in some of the earliest works of science fiction. We will consider this theme as it appears in stories of intergalactic voyages, utopian societies, and encounters with extraterrestrial beings, paying special attention to the ways in which early modern writers used these tales to speculate on philosophical, political, and scientific issues.

EMSP 2360 Magic, Science and the Occult: from Antiquity to Postmodernity
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The "Scientific Revolution" is ordinarily construed as the triumph of reason over superstition, of science over sorcery. This course argues that the rhetoric of "Enlightenment" conceals a deep continuity between modern science and the occult traditions of the middle ages and the Renaissance. The prototype of the experimental scientist is the Faustian magus. We investigate the role of Hermeticism, magic, and the occult in the scientific revolution and the persistence of these esoteric currents in later movements, from German Naturphilosophie to Jungian psychology.

European encounters with non-European cultures in the early modern period shaped national economies, political power, and European self-understanding. Confrontation with non-European societies reinforced hegemonic, reflective, and self-critical aspects of European culture. The course analyzes how writers and artists implicitly engaged in clarifying and criticizing European identity as they came to terms with non-Europeans. The texts and images derive from Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, English, French, and Dutch sources from the late middle ages to the end of the eighteenth century. The contexts include Southeast Asia, India, Africa, North and South America, Polynesia, and purely imaginary settings.

An important development in early modern Europe is the emergence of the commercial society in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course will consider literary works by authors who grappled with the moral implications of the growth of commercial society in Europe, particularly in England at the beginning of the eighteenth century. These authors sought to understand and to some extent criticize the notion of a society chiefly devoted to the acquisition of economic wealth. Furthermore, they employed literary genres such as travel literature and satire to explore the changing conceptions of virtue and vice in Europe, thus presenting often ambiguous treatments of commercial society. As well, reference will be made throughout to other philosophical and artistic works of the period.

A central preoccupation in early modern European culture, particularly in the eighteenth century, was that of the attainment of happiness in one’s private life and in society in general. Happiness was seen as the highest good by some thinkers - as arguably reflected, on a political level, in the American constitution - while others argued against the identification of happiness with goodness. This course will examine various literary and philosophical texts in which the pursuit of happiness in its diverse senses is an important theme.

EMSP 3210 The Ideal World of Enlightenment: Desire and Freedom
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In the course of criticizing tradition and integrating the experience of Renaissance and the Reformation, in responding to the beginnings of modern natural science and modern political institutions, early modern Europeans sought in diverse – and often conflicting – ways to express the self-understanding of Enlightenment. By the end of the eighteenth century, science, morality, and art were seen as different realms of activity in which questions of truth, justice, and taste could be separately determined, that is, evaluated according to their specific criteria of validity. This course will consider how these differences compelled European philosophers and theologians, artists and social theorists, to develop and expand their self-understanding to the point where enlightened reason could properly reflect the formal divisions of culture and make critical judgements in relation to them. Special attention will be paid to the relationship between faith and knowledge and the growing sense of conflict between religion and secular freedom.

In enlightened European culture, religion, state, and society as well as science, morality, and art were gradually separated from one another under exclusively formal points of view, and subordinated to a critical reason that took on the role of a supreme judge. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, many Europeans began to question the self-understanding evoked by the principle of critical reason. This course will consider how enlightened freedom and reason moved European philosophers and theologians, artists, and social theorists, to conceive of themselves historically, that is, to become conscious of the dissolution of tradition, and of the need to ground the divisions of culture in ideal forms of unity derived from the tradition. The course will pay particular attention to the relationship between religion and the demand that the unifying force in culture come from a dialectic residing in the principle of enlightened reason itself.

EMSP 3230 Impersonations: Theatre, Performance, and Identity in Early Modern England
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In his celebrated "Oration on the Dignity of Man," Pico della Mirandola glorified man’s ability to “transform himself into what he most wills, taking like a chameleon the colour of all those things to which he is most nigh.” For Pico as for many early modern thinkers, human subjects were distinguished less by preordained identities than by an actor-like ability to fashion and perform new selves. In early modern England, the burgeoning commercial theatre became a focal point for cultural debates about the social and ethical ramifications of this performative construction of the self. This course will explore these debates both as they relate to the growth of the professional theatre and in terms of their wider implications for early modern English society. We will begin by looking at the roles traditionally played by performance in the affirmation of identities both aristocratic and plebian. We will then go on to examine a number of plays from the main genres performed in English public theatres between 1590 and 1640. By reading these plays alongside primary sources from conduct manuals to statutes for theatre governance, and from playwrights’ celebrations of their art to Puritans’ attacks on the theatre’s degeneracy, we will consider the huge range of cultural responses to the relationship between performance and identity in a rapidly shifting social order. Special attention will be paid to the interrogations of class, gender, sexuality, and morality implied in these works, and to their far-reaching effect on English society before and after the closure of the public theatres in 1642.

EMSP 3280 Love, Lust, and Desire in Italian Renaissance Art
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Love, lust, and desire – both spiritual and secular – are among the dominant themes in Italian Renaissance art and literature. In this course, we will examine the ways in which the artists, poets, theologians, and philosophers of this period struggled to define, and to represent, the complexities of love in all its facets. We will analyze the thematics of desire in male and female portraiture and mythological paintings, the erotics of mysticism in altarpieces, and the taboos of sex in early modern printmaking.

Printmaking transformed how early modern artists put ideas to paper, told archetypal stories, and documented the natural world and contemporary events. It also altered how art was received and collected. Examining the material culture of prints thus engages a range of questions: from aesthetics to economics to cross-cultural knowledge transmission.

EMSP 3321 In Search of the Philosopher's Stone: The History of European Alchemy
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course traces the development of alchemical theories and practices in the medieval Latin west up to the emergence of early modern chemistry. It employs a multi-disciplinary approach which treats the scientific, technological, esoteric, and iconographic dimensions of alchemy as interdependent. The entire development of European alchemy is covered from the transmission of the Greek and Islamic alchemical traditions in the 12th century up to Newton, whose alchemical theories represent a point of transition to early modern chemistry in one direction, and to a more spiritualised occult philosophy in the other.This course is independent of HSTC 3120.03.

EMSP 3330 Science and Religion: Historical Perspectives
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Beginning with an overview of the history and methodology of the study of science and religion, encounters between science and religion are traced from the dawn of civilization to the end of the eighteenth century, with a special focus on the early modern period. From an examination of the biblical view of nature, ancient Babylonian astrology and divination, and Plato's Timaeus, this course moves through a treatment of the centrality of theology to Medieval science on to natural theology and the “Watchmaker” Design Argument of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Models of conflict, harmony and complementarity offered to characterize relations between science and religion are explored through case studies such as Galileo’s controversy with the Church and instances where religious belief inspired scientists like Boyle and Newton. Claims that certain confessional traditions (notably Protestantism and its dissenting offshoots) facilitated the rise of modern science are also appraised. Science-religion relations are examined both from the standpoint of mainstream religion and with respect to religious heterodoxy, prophecy, alchemy, magic and witchcraft. This course employs examples from Islamic cultures in addition to the Judeo-Christian tradition. Special features include a focus on primary texts and guest lectures by scientists.

EMSP 3340 Knowledge is Power: Francis Bacon and the Birth of Modernity
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Modern western culture draws close connections between three facets of human experience: a) our knowledge of nature; b) our visions of what it is to be human; and c) power, or the political, social, and technological means by which we relate the first two: nature and human nature. The Renaissance period (roughly 1400-1630) was highly influential in laying the foundations for such modern connections, even as it seems to us to be a period rather different from our own. We will examine those connections in an exploration primarily of the work of Francis Bacon (1561 - 1626).

EMSP 3420 Religious Warfare and Political Theology in the Early Modern Period
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Europe witnessed tremendous upheavals in society, in part caused by religiously based strife. Many thinkers responded to these events by formulating “political theologies”, i.e., interpretations of religious teachings especially as contained in scripture with a view to assessing the political consequences of religion and to harmonizing religious interpretations with a particular conception of political life. We shall examine various continental European and British texts of the early modern period which are both timely and thoughtful reflections on Christian teachings as they relate to and sometimes conflict with the philosophical underpinnings of the modern state and religious freedom.

EMSP 3430 Theories of Punishment: Retribution and Social Control in Early Modern Thought
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Among the distinctive characteristics of early modern thought are new conceptions of retribution and social control. In this course, we shall examine a number of texts which reflect the diversity of philosophical and theological approaches to law and punishment, both human and divine. We begin with a consideration of pre-modern and/or non-western approaches to these issues. We then explore the various early modern reactions to and departures from these approaches, including the writings of Protestant thinkers and political philosophers before, during, and after the Enlightenment. Finally, we shall consider Foucault’s “normalization thesis” to see if it illuminates our understanding of early modern thought on punishment.

Thus, we shall critically analyze the radical transformations of early modern texts that were undertaken in order to make these works relevant to social and political questions centuries later.

EMSP 4300 Nature and Romanticism
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Kant’s “Copernican Revolution” in philosophy, ironically, marked a resurrection of a full-blown “idealist” philosophy of nature. This course will investigate the attempts of Kant’s followers to construct a natural philosophy and its engagement with the rival mechanical world picture. It explores the implications of this endeavour for the growth of romanticism, vitalism, and our modern picture of “nature”. It begins with an examination of the ambiguous heritage presented by Kant’s writings on nature and proceeds through the attempts to develop a complete program of idealist Naturphilosophie and its spread throughout European thought by the medium of romanticist art and natural philosophy.

EMSP 4310 Newton and Newtonianism
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This seminar involves a close study of the work of Isaac Newton, along with that of his supporters and detractors. Beginning with an overview of pre-Newtonian science, topics range from Newton’s rejection of Cartesianism through his contributions to mathematics, physics, astronomy and optics, along with his inductive scientific method, laws of motion, and calculus priority dispute with Leibniz. Also considered are lesser-known aspects of his career, such as his secretive pursuit of alchemy, his heretical theology, his attempts to unravel the apocalypse, his role in British statecraft, and his autocratic rule of the Royal Society. A taxonomy of the forms of Newtonianism that emerged after Newton’s death also allows an exploration of iconographical and apologetic uses of Newton, and his differing legacies in the Britain and France. This seminar concentrates on primary readings, including Newton’s Principia (1687), Opticks (1740), alchemical treatises and unpublished theological papers, as well as the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence (1717), anti-Newtoniana, and eighteenth-century popularizations of Newtonianism such as Voltaire’s Philosophical Letters (1733) and Maclaurin’s Account of Newton’s Discoveries (1748). Attention is paid to the social, cultural, and political aspects of Newtonianism and no prior knowledge of science is required.

 Introduction
The study of English includes both analysis of texts and awareness of contexts. The texts proposed for analysis in various English courses will range from the long-established to the contemporary; English is a discipline which includes writings by such authors as Chinua Achebe, Jane Austen, Geoffrey Chaucer, Olaudah Equiano, Tomson Highway, Alice Munro, John Milton, and Toni Morrison, among others from past and present. The wide range of human experience represented in these texts can provide the student with what Kenneth Burke has called "equipment for living" and Audre Lorde has called “the foundations for a future of change.” In more practical terms, the discipline of English fosters the development of various human skills: it requires the student to think, and to use language with clarity, judgment, and imagination.
But individual works of literature are also related in various ways to their social, cultural, and political contexts. For this reason, curiosity about a particular text often leads to enquiries that touch upon history, philosophy, politics, religion, biography, and the fine arts as well. The written text turns out to be a bridge between an individual sensibility and the rest of the world. The value of English studies, therefore, though difficult to measure, can be discovered both in the large semiologies of the cultures to which we belong, and in the smallest nuances of the language we use.
The calendar descriptions describe all English courses. Not all are offered in any given year. Students should consult the English Department website for updated information about which courses are offered this year, and to get detailed descriptions of courses (with booklists). There is a variety of first-year (1000-level) English courses to suit all inclinations and needs, and all sections with a number ending in -0 or -5 can be used to fulfill the
 671
 
University Writing Requirement. Once the first year is complete, students may register in any course at the 2000 or 3000 level. Many of the 2000-level courses are open to anyone with a Writing Requirement course in any discipline, while the smaller and more historically-focused 3000-level courses are open to both majors and non- majors. More intensive seminars at the 4000 level are mainly intended for students in their third and fourth years of an English Major or Honours program.

Courses
Courses
Below you will find descriptions for courses offered in this field of study. You will find a general overview of the topics covered and any prerequisite course or grade requirements, credit value and exclusions.
The first digit of the course indicates the general level. Those in the 1000 series are introductory degree level. Courses at the 2000, 3000, 4000 series are typically available to students in the second, third, and fourth year.
  677
 
Courses numbered at the 5000 level or above are graduate level. Courses listed at the 0100 or 0200 series are technology level courses. Courses below the 0100 level are generally non credit courses.
Some courses are listed as exclusionary to one another. This means that students may not obtain credit for both courses as designated.
Not all courses are offered each year. Please consult the current timetable for this year’s offering. For further information please contact the department, or visit the department's website.
English Courses at the 1000 level
The study of English at the 1000 level allows students to experience the variety and excitement of thinking in the verbal arts, and to develop techniques for analyzing, creating and writing about texts.
Any 6 credit hour course, or any two 3 credit hour courses in English at the 1000 level with numbers ending in -0 or -5, will fulfill the College of Arts and Sciences Writing Requirement. The same course or courses will fulfill the College of Arts and Sciences Languages and Humanities requirement, and may serve as the prerequisite for English courses at the 2000 and 3000
levels. Students may take more than six credit hours in English at the 1000 level but must pay particular attention to exclusions.
Courses at the 1000 level with numbers ending in 1 (e.g., ENGL 1041 or ENGL 1051) are similar to the corresponding courses with numbers ending in 0 (e.g., ENGL 1040 or ENGL 1050), but they do not fulfill the Writing Requirement. They are offered for students who are interested in the subject, or are seeking to fulfill the Languages and Humanities requirement. They are typically taught as subsections of the corresponding Writing Requirement course; they are taught by the same instructor, usually in the same room at the same time (for example ENGL 1041 is taught with ENGL 1040), but with less emphasis on writing instruction.
English Courses at the 2000 level
Courses at the 2000 level are open to any student above the first year, with the necessary prerequisites. They include surveys of historical periods, national literatures, and major fields intended as an entrance into the discipline of literary studies, as well as a colorful selection of genre-, author- and topic-oriented courses.
English Courses at the 3000 Level
Courses at the 3000 level include three overviews of critical methods (ENGL 3000.03, ENGL 3001.03, ENGL 3002.03), as well as a sequence of courses that together span the historical and cultural breadth of literary writing in English. All of these courses are open to students beyond their first year who have completed the necessary prerequisites.
English Courses at the 4000 Level
Courses at the 4000 level are small seminars intended for third and fourth-year English majors or honours students, offering intensive, research-oriented study of special topics, particular authors or periods, national traditions, literary or cultural forms and theories. Reflecting the specialties of their instructors, their subjects change every year. Students must request permission to register in any 4000 level English course.Students who have declared English as part of their program will be contacted prior to the beginning of the registration period and asked to submit their seminar preferences. Priority for available seats will be given to students entering their

final year of study. Detailed descriptions of this year’s seminars will be available on the English department website.

ENGL 2010 The Personal Essay
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In the personal essay we use moments and material from our lives to communicate meaning to a reader. The trick of it, suggests Philip Lopate, is to “make the small loom large” by using the humble details of daily life to address some aspect of the human condition. With this challenge in mind, this course considers a wide range of personal essays and allows students to try their hands at writing in this form. Class time will be divided between the analysis of published essays and the development of original work.

ENGL 3070 Twentieth-Century African American Novel
CREDIT HOURS: 3
While it is obvious that several of the novelists on this reading list might well appear in other courses, it is a worthwhile exercise for students to engage in a conversation about these and other texts by African American novelists in the context of African American novelists. That context will be the focus of this course. Such a comparatively restricted focus brings with it such questions as does it matter that these novels were written by African Americans? What do we gain/lose by considering these texts in this specific national and ethno-cultural context? Are the texts representative, and if so, of what and in what ways? Do these texts reinforce or complicate (or both) notions such as the African American experience?

CRWR 2010 The Personal Essay
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In the personal essay we use moments and material from our lives to communicate meaning to a reader. The trick of it, suggests Philip Lopate, is to “make the small loom large” by using the humble details of daily life to address some aspect of the human condition. With this challenge in mind, this course considers a wide range of personal essays and allows students to try their hands at writing in this form. Class time will be divided between the analysis of published essays and the development of original work.

Introduction
The European Studies program at Dalhousie is designed to guide students to a multidisciplinary understanding of contemporary Europe. It is not housed in any one department but is a combined effort of most departments in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and the University of King’s College. It encourages students to develop a broad perspective on Europe as seen through history and politics, literature and ideas, and the fine arts, with special emphasis placed on acquisition of language skills. There is an Honours program and a 120 credit hour Major. Because it is already a multidisciplinary program, European Studies cannot be combined with other subjects to form a combined honours degree.

BA Honours in European Studies
Students must meet the faculty requirements for honours.
Year I
A full-time student takes 30 credit hours in the first year, meeting the distribution requirements of the BA. These courses include:
• 6 credit hours of writing requirement courses

to the Present; or equivalent course(s) totaling 6 credit hours in a later year
• 6 credit hours of a language other than English
• 6 credit hours of social sciences courses
• 6 credit hours of natural science courses
Notes: Completion of the King’s College Foundation Year Program satisfies the first-year requirements for European Studies, with the exception of the language course and the natural sciences course.
Some students may wish to take another "second language" course in the first year, and postpone one of the other courses until a later year.
Years II to IV
The program consists of a further 90 credit hours including the second year core course and an Honours project. The general requirements for the program are:
• Courses in two contemporary European languages other than English. One of these languages is studied up to 3000/4000 level (six credit hours each year). The minimum requirement for the other language is six credit hours at the first year level, though students are strongly encouraged to take advanced courses in both languages.
• 66-78 credit hours with significant European content. As this is a multidisciplinary program, no more than 30 credit hours above the 1000 level may be taken from one department. No fewer than 36 credit hours must be taken from two other departments. These may include courses from a language department to fulfill the language requirement, or one of the King’s Honours programs. At least 18 credit hours must be at the 3000 level or above, taken in at least two different departments. Courses taken during a study abroad year will need to be counted in the above mix.
• EURO 2101.03, EURO 2102.03

First Year Interest Group
First Year Interest Groups (FIGs)
a start for university success
What is a FIG and why sign up?
A First Year Interest Group, or FIG, is a group of students who meet weekly for an hour during the fall term of their first year at Dal. Groups are typically composed of students (about 15-20 per group) who have similar academic interests or goals, and who are enrolled in some of the same first year courses.
FIGs complement the classroom experience and help new students adjust to university. Signing up for a FIG allows you to meet other new students with similar interests. It can help you find study partners, share ideas, and maybe even form lasting friendships. It can also help you become better informed about the resources Dal offers to students and about life in Halifax. FIGs are free, informal, interactive groups that will help you make the most out of your first year at Dal.
What will I do in a FIG?
• Get to know other students. (Maybe you’ll find a study partner.)
• Meet Dal faculty and students who work in your area of interest
• Find out how to get involved (volunteer opportunities, events, clubs)
• Learn about future opportunities for students with your interests (e.g., scholarships, summer research,
co-op, study abroad)
Who should enrol in a FIG?
Any new student in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences who has been accepted as a first year undeclared BA student can enrol in a FIG.
How do I enrol in a FIG?
You enroll in a FIG when you register for your regular courses, using the same registration procedure. First, make sure that the time slot of the FIG doesn’t conflict with the times of your other courses. Then register for the appropriate FIG section (FIGA 0001, 0002, etc.) Your student advisor can help if you have questions.
Does a FIG count toward my degree?
The FIG will appear on your academic transcript – it will be obvious to future employers along with the credit courses you complete. However, because it is not for credit, a FIG does not count as part of the 90 or 120 credit hours you must complete for a BA degree.
Will I receive a grade for my FIG?
If you complete the FIG, it will appear on your academic transcript with a P (pass) beside it. Grades are not given for FIGs, and FIGs are not included in calculation of your GPA. However, to receive a P you must participate in the FIG sessions (unless you are ill, of course).
What if I don’t like my FIG?
We expect that most students will enjoy their FIG, and will feel that the time has been well spent. After all, finding others with similar interests is a key part of an enjoyable and successful university experience. However, if for some reason you find that you do not want to participate in your FIG, you may withdraw. The FIG will then not appear on your transcript.
 725
 
Can I sign up for more than one FIG?
No. We want to offer the opportunity to participate in a FIG to as many students as possible, and so students may not register in more than one group.

 Introduction
The Department of French offers students not only the opportunity to develop fluency in courses backed up by computer-aided language learning facilities, but also the possibility of studying the literature and culture of France, French Canada and the other countries and regions of the French-speaking world, as well as the linguistic structure and development of French.
Courses are available for beginners and for those with a background in the language who wish to improve and maintain any or all of the following skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Other courses are specially designed for students who are interested in translation, or other areas of language study. The role of French in Canada and in the Maritimes is stressed in courses in Acadian and Québec literature and civilization. The literature of France and French-speaking nations is brought to life in courses organized around a theme, a genre, or an historical period.
The Department of French urges students to practise the language as much as possible. The French Club organizes activities including films, French meals, parties and plays in which all students may participate. Participation in immersion programs and individual student travel and study are encouraged. Please consult the Department for information and see below: Studies in a Francophone Environment.
A BA degree in French with Honours, or with Honours in French and another allied subject, may lead the student to a career in education, translation or interpreting, or may provide the background for careers in many fields, including radio, television, new media, public service, tourism, law, social work, public relations, business, politics, diplomacy, journalism, and library and information science. Students considering French as a Minor in a BA, BSc or other degree program are invited to discuss the matter at any time (the earlier the better) with a departmental advisor. The focus is on the particular needs and aspirations of the individual. An Honours degree is normally required for access to graduate studies: MA and PhD degrees may be pursued in the Department (see the Calendar for Faculty of Graduate Studies).
The French Department offers a number of academic awards to students, including the Ruth Murray Scholarship, the French Department Scholarship, the Marcelle Cendres Sandhu Memorial Prize, the Sabah Metlej French Scholarship, the Prof. and Mrs. Robert Lloyd Mcintosh Prize, the Prix de l’Alliance française, and Embassy and Consular book prizes. The Department encourages graduating students to apply for an eight month teaching assistantship in France, offered by the French Embassy.
Students may, with the approval of the Department of French, take up to one year of study at a University in a francophone environment and receive credit at Dalhousie. In particular, students may spend a semester or year of study abroad through our Dijon Study Abroad Program. Bursaries may be available for students selected to participate in a Dalhousie "Studies in a Francophone Environment" program.
The BA language requirement exemption test in French is given in the April examination period. Students should register at the Registrar’s Office before mid January by completing an Application for Exemption from the
BA Language Requirement. A copy of the form must be provided to the French Department. Please note that passing the BA language requirement exemption test does not give a course credit.

 Introduction
Gender and Women’s Studies is a dynamic and rapidly expanding interdisciplinary area of study. An alternative to the traditional curriculum, Gender and Women’s Studies provides students with the opportunity to examine history, social structures, the sciences, language, literature, and culture from critical and illuminating perspectives.
At Dalhousie, students can currently enter the following programs in Gender and Women’s Studies: a Minor, a Major, a Double Major, or a Combined Honours program. These programs include courses in the disciplines of Economics, English, History, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology and Social Anthropology, and Theatre, and in interdisciplinary and professional fields, including Contemporary Studies, Early Modern Studies, Health Promotion, International Development, Law, and Nursing.
Students in the Dalhousie Gender and Women’s Studies program develop a critical understanding of gender as a category of analysis in scholarly enquiry, social dynamics, cultural expression, and belief systems. They also investigate the ways in which gender intersects with other variables such as race, class, and cultural difference. They study women’s contributions to civilization in many fields of knowledge, and examine the social and ideological forces that have made these contributions "invisible" in the past. Through exposure to a large and growing body of research in a number of disciplines and fields, Gender and Women’s Studies Majors gain a grounding in the methodologies and concepts shaping the organization and dissemination of knowledge.
Our courses also provide students with opportunities of uniting theory with social and cultural practice, addressing contemporary issues that individuals and institutions are grappling within today’s changing world order. They provide a context in which women can find strength and insight through exchanging experiences and ideas with
 759
 
other women, and a context in which women and men together can further human understanding and equality through exploring and respecting differences.
Do men take Gender and Women’s Studies courses? Yes. Gender has operated as a fundamental category in the organization of knowledge, social systems, forms of representation and modes of production and consumption. The critical examination of gender is relevant to both men and women.
Degree Programs
Gender and Women’s Studies programs provide preparation for careers in a variety of fields, as well as for professional schools or graduate programs. For example, graduates can work as consultants, policy analysts, and officers in government and para-governmental organizations, in business and industry, and in educational institutions. The fields they enter include employment equity, public administration, international development, health care, work place conditions, personnel relations, publishing and editorial work, and public relations.
For students interested in a preparatory degree, Gender and Women’s Studies programs provide appropriate preparation for professional schools and programs in the fields of education, social work, counselling, journalism, the health professions, and certain areas of law. They also provide suitable preparation for graduate programs in Women’s Studies, Gender Studies, Interdisciplinary Studies, Cultural Studies, and studies in Social Justice. Students interested in proceeding to graduate work should enter a four-year degree program.
Students may enter Gender and Women’s Studies programs in the first, second, or third year of study. In many cases, students in second or third years may already have acquired some Gender and Women’s Studies credits through taking courses in the traditional disciplines or in other interdisciplinary programs that are cross-listed with Gender and Women’s Studies core courses.
NOTE: In addition to the departmental requirements listed below, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Degree Requirements section.

GWST 1010 Introduction to Gender and Women's Studies
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Gender and Women's Studies is an interdisciplinary field aimed at developing a critical understanding of gender as a category of analysis in scholarly enquiry and social dynamics. Paying close attention to the experiences and perspectives of women, students have the opportunity to examine history, social structures, the sciences, language, literature, culture from the illuminating perspective of gender. In all these areas, Gender and Women's Studies investigates how gender intersects with other variables such as race, class, and cultural difference. This introductory course provides an overview of some of the central topics of Gender and Women's Studies, such as the sex/gender distinction, understanding sexualities, the social construction of motherhood, changing definitions of masculinity and femininity, and the place of sex and gender cross-culturally.

GWST 1015 Gender and Diversity
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course continues from "Introduction to Gender and Women's Studies" to focus particularly on the many ways that gender as a social system interacts with other systems of power and inequality. We all make sense of our lives through multiple identities that combine in shifting ways to define our opportunities for action and the limits we face. Identities based on gender, race, ethnicity, age, class, sexuality, disability, nation, or religion are blended in varied ways for individuals, but they are not just individual self-perceptions. They are also elements of larger social systems. Topics may include the multiple identities of the body; race, gender, and violence; diversity and work; contemporary transformations of the family; and gender and globalization.

GWST 2310 Women and Gender in Early Modern Science
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course will explore the roles of women, and questions about women’s nature, in the development of early modern science. The course will consider several interrelated aspects of scientific culture in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries: first, we will look at the place of women in the scientific institutions of the time. Although women were, for the most part, excluded from universities and scientific academies, some women were able to do scientific work through their participation in salons and craft guilds. The second part of the course will look at the contributions of some particular women to the fields of physics, astronomy, botany, and medicine. We will then examine how science interpreted sex and gender. We will pay special attention to the biological sciences and their treatments of sex differences, conception, and generation. We will consider how these biological theories were influenced by, and at the same time used to uphold, various political and social structures. Finally, the course will explore the ways in which gender and nature were portrayed in the broader cultural context. We will, for example, discuss the ways in which women were depicted as scientists and as symbols of science in art and literature.

Theorists such as Frantz Fanon and Anne McClintock have argued that the colonial encounter has been a sexual and sexualized undertaking, undergirded by regimes of power. This course Colonialism and the Body uses sex, sexuality, and gender as the starting point from which to interrogate and examine the meanings attached to the bodies of the colonized and colonizer, and the social, spatial, political locations of these bodies during the heyday of European colonization, and further, in this supposedly postcolonial moment. We will examine diverse forms of colonialism (internal, direct, and indirect) in specific locations around the globe, including Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, and in parts of Africa and Asia. Topics include slavery and the slave trade, European contact with indigenous societies, Africville, Oka, sports, racial science, racialization of the African body, and colonial crime and punishment.

This course will begin with an overview discussing what is feminism? There is no way to come to a definitive answer to this question; therefore, the first month of classes will focus on readings and discussion of feminism from an historical perspective. We will investigate the three historical waves of feminism and the diversity of feminism found in the social sciences. After this brief introduction, we will concentrate on gender and sex, clearly dominant themes found in feminist works. We will approach this by critically exploring socio cultural constructions of sex and gender, which in turn will shed critical light on feminist perspectives about the relationship between these two concepts.

A variety of documentaries made by women from diverse backgrounds will be screened and analyzed along with a close reading of selected critical texts. Students will identify the similarities and differences in subjects, themes, style, aesthetics, and approached to creation, production and distribution. CALENDAR NOTES:

GWST 3350 Rewriting Gender
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Against a widespread view that postmodernism is inimical to feminism, the readings in this course demonstrate that recent literature by women, both fiction and critical theory, has widely adopted postmodern strategies in order to advance feminist views. The postmodern canon has allowed female authors to question the way in which woman’s subjectivity has always been constructed through male-oriented processes of signification. The works of fiction covered in this course, by Kathy Acker, Angela Carter, Marianna Hauser, Octavia Butler, and others, exemplify aesthetic subversions of phallocentric discourses. Literary texts will be supplemented with theoretical works by leading feminist/post-structuralist thinkers such as Judith Butler, Drucilla Cornell, Diane Elam, and Gayatri Spivak. The course includes video-taped material and slide-shows of postmodern feminist art.

Representations of women and constructs of femininity are a significant part of mainstream western political thought. This course explores these topics in the work of leading western philosophers, such as Aristotle, Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, with attention to understanding the relation of ideas of sexual difference to general systems of thought. The course also considers how conceptions of gender difference and equality shape contemporary political, legal and philosophical discourses and practices, including in feminist critical theory and international human rights scholarship and activism. We will consider the arguments and strategies used by men and women in the past century to address systemic discrimination and advance gender equality.

GWST 3800 Gender and Health
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course aims to reflect upon and challenge our taken-for-granted assumptions about the gendered dimensions of health and healthcare. Rather than take the categories of 'women's health' and 'men's health' as its foundation, the course revolves around two main questions: (1) how does the field of health and healthcare define and enforce the very categories of 'women' and 'men'?; (2) how does gender, thus defined and enforced, affect the health, healthcare, and health work of those defined as men, women, or other? We will consider these questions by examining particular health topics that have a strongly gendered component, such as sexual health, reproductive health, and disability. Throughout the course, we will explore the theoretical perspectives used in the field; the two-sex model and challenges to it; the gendering of particular health problems and health professions; the medicalization of womanhood and, more recently, manhood; and the relationships between gender and other forms of social classification (e.g. race, class, sexual orientation).

GWST 3810 Women and Aging
CREDIT HOURS: 3
As women grow older the experience of aging is generally more difficult for them than for men. Somewhere in the forties, anxieties about the aging process exacerbate the difficulties facing women in modern society. Disempowering older women is usually accomplished in small increments. “Old woman” is a pejorative label; the older a woman becomes, the less credibility she generally has; this is especially true for women of color, poor women, lesbians, and women who are physically challenged. While aging is a biological phenomenon, ageism is socially constructed. Specifically, under patriarchy, older women are seen as a burden, desexualized and segregated by both men and younger women. They are usually not taken very seriously, nor seen as a threat. This course will explore the issues related to social, psychological, political and economic factors that are major determinants to the well-being of aging women based upon race, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities and class inequities.

GWST 3911 Gender in Theatre: A Cross-Cultural Survey
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This seminar course examines the roles gender has played in the shaping of world theatre alongside the roles the theatre has played in the shaping of various cultural conceptions of gender. By exploring plays and performances from Europe, North America, China, Japan, India, Iranand/or other traditions, we will strive to understand the ways in which various forms of representation reflect their cultures’ governing images of masculinity and femininity. In the process, we will interrogate the historical and cultural variability of the notion of ‘gender’ itself. The main objective of the seminar will be to ask how gender determines performers’ choices in various cultures, and to see how gender itself can actually be shaped by performance.

GWST 4303 The Birth of Pop: How visual Culture Makes Meaning
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Contemporary western society is saturated with visual images of all kinds: from oil painting to pornography. Visual culture is not only becoming more diverse but also increasingly globalized. For these reasons alone, the study of popular visual culture is an important pursuit. But popular images, like all visual images, also carry meaning and generate effects. The first part of this course explores the origins of mass popular culture in 19th Century Britain. Through case studies, suggesting that Western ideas about mental health, gender, romance, weddings and marriage emerged and were transmitted though Victorian visual culture, students learn to see connections between the popular culture of the past and contemporary visuality. Students will also critique the development of cultural studies as a discipline and form their own theoretical positions. In the second part, students will conduct their own self- directed primary research into a visual popular culture topic of their choosing. In the final weeks of the course, students will be asked to reflect on the course as a whole, consolidate what they have learned, and articulate the connections (or disruptions) they see between historical and contemporary theory and practice. This course is ideally suited to students who want to incorporate visual or popular culture sources in their Honours or MA thesis.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
Earthquakes, meteorite impacts, rapid climate change, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, landslides, solar flares, and floods are natural disasters that affect our economy, public policy, and safety. Where, why and how frequently do natural disasters occur? Are predictions possible? Are media portrayals of risk and damage realistic? This course, aimed at the nonspecialist, investigates these intriguing questions. Excerpts of “disaster films”, in conjunction with lectures and discussions are used to identify the causes, consequences and sometimes erroneous perceptions of natural hazards. Examples from Atlantic Canada and contemporary disasters are used to assess local risk and real-time events worldwide.

GEOG 2100 Environment and Culture
CREDIT HOURS: 6
Concern about the environment is a widespread phenomenon as virtually everyone is confronted by environmental issues -- be they global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer or the continuing problems of water pollution and solid waste disposal. Furthermore, we are becoming increasingly aware of that environmental issues often have global implications. The efforts of cities in Canada to deal with environmental pollution, for example, may lead to conflicts with rural regions. Similarly, rural regions, in their use of various chemical agents, may find themselves affecting the lives of city dwellers. This class will explore key relationships between human culture and the physical environment. Topics to be examined include: historical, social, and legal aspects of contemporary environmentalism, food and agriculture, environmental ethics, health, traditional ecological knowledge, sustainable forestry, waste management, public participation and environmental movements.

 Introduction
German, the most widely used language in Europe, is spoken by approximately 100 million people as their native tongue in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, and some parts of Eastern Europe. The cultural, economic, and scientific role of the German-speaking countries makes the knowledge of German indispensable to the study of most academic disciplines. The number of publications in the German language is second only to the number published in English.
The departmental program "German Studies" is the investigation of German culture and its place in the formation of the modern world. The program concentrates on significant aspects of the cultural tradition of the German- speaking countries. From Luther to Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx, German writers have moved people and nations to change the course of the world. The literary and intellectual development of Germany culminated around 1800 in the epochs of "klassik" and "romantik". The authors of this epoch (Lessing, Herder, Goethe, Schiller, Novalis, The Schlegel brothers, and Hegel) founded their writings on a thorough knowledge of the cultural tradition of Europe, especially Greek culture. As scientists, historians, and politicians they described problems and questions of a universal nature in their works. They became the first historians of literature and created the discipline of aesthetics. The universality of the authors of the period 1770-1830 explains their present-day relevance and makes the study of German important and attractive.
Major or honours students may, with the approval of the Department of German, take up to one year (30 credit hours) at a university in a German-speaking country and receive credit at Dalhousie. The Department has study abroad arrangements with the universities of Heidelberg and Freiburg. In addition there is a "visiting scholars" program which brings distinguished scholars from Germany to Dalhousie.
For students of German for Business who have taught for a year with the Pädagogischer Austauschdienst (PAD), which is an Education Exchange Service in Germany, the Department offers access to one of the most prestigious MBA programs in International Industrial Management in Germany at the FH-Esslingen in co-operation with Daimler and Bosch.
For advanced Engineering students, the Department offers access to the MSc in Automotive Engineering and the MSc in Information Technology and Automation Systems at the same Graduate School.
Degree Programs
In addition to the departmental requirements listed below, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Degree Requirements section.
The following programs are normally followed, other possibilities do exist. Students considering a degree in German are advised to consult with the undergraduate advisor of the Department.

GERM 2600 'Freiheit'. Freedom in German Literature and Thought I
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In contrast to other European literatures of the 18th century with their utilitarian and moralistic aims, the German Sturm and Drang movement puts the individual into the centre. A secular society demands a new conception of man ("Mensch") liberated from God and the gods. As a consequence, the traditional view of man inherited from Aristotelian poetics is replaced by characters who shape their own destiny. A new myth of a defiant Prometheus is created by Goethe. German idealism formulates a new theory of freedom which was summed up by Kant in the categorical imperative. Goethe's Iphigenie illustrates the humanism of the epoch. The ultimate freedom, however, can only be achieved in the artistic realm. Again, Goethe provides the model in his Divan.Texts by J.M.R. Lenz, Goethe, Schiller, Winckelmann, Kant, and others will be read. Translations will be offered. Language of instruction: English. This course should appeal to students interested in the history of ideas.

GERM 2601 'Freiheit'. Freedom in German Literature and Thought II. 19th and 20th century
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Goethe's Divan opens our discussion, Goethe follows the Persian poet Hafiz to the Orient. There he finds freedom of the imagination which enables him to ignore the reality of the Napoleonic wars. Goethe's avoidance of reality became the role model for the Symbolist
 803
 
movement. The German Romantics placed a writer's imaginative capacity ("Fantasie") and subjectivity ("Witz" and "Ironie") higher than any concerns about objective reality. New forces, like chance ("Zufall"), counter man's perceived freedom, as is shown in the works of Henrich von Kleist. The dependence on circumstances, social structures and natural laws becomes the great topic of Realism and Naturalism. The human being without hope, faith or the chance of salvation is manifested in Büchner's works. Finally, the existential crisis of modern man finds its most representative expression in the works of Franz Kafka.Texts by Goethe, Gautier, Kleist, Büchner, Kafka and others will be read in the original. English translations will be provided. Language of instruction: English, This course should appeal to students interested in the history of ideas. Attendance of Part I is not a prerequisite.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course looks at the history of German philosophy from the Enlightenment to the End of German Idealism. Part one examines the early history of German philosophy, focusing on German Idealism. Students will gain a broad overview of German intellectual history through focused readings of key texts. The goal is to understand how the ideas formed in this tradition contribute to both the core philosophic disciplines (such as metaphysics, epistemology and moral philosophy) as well as other fields (like history, aesthetics, psychology, and political thought). Our focus will be on the construction of the free autonomous subject—the basis for our understanding of democratic institutions.

GERM 3400 Germany and Europe: The Cultural Union
CREDIT HOURS: 6
Modern German literature is shaped by the orient (Les mille et une nuits 1704-1717), by Winckelmann's discovery of Greek sculpture and the reception of Shakespeare and Milton in the mid 18th century. The Sturm and Drang movement used the works of Shakespeare as its inspiration to create a radical anti-Aristotelian concept of drama and of man. Writers of this period created an “open form” of drama which foreshadowed the plays of Büchner and Brecht. The new concept of man spread throughout Europe, becoming the basis for European Romanticism. German Romanticism, however, is quite different from its European counterparts; its influence is felt by European Symbolists like Baudelaire and Mallarmé. This course aims to study the interconnectedness of the European national arts and literatures. A reading knowledge of German, French and English is required.

 Introduction
Just as people need to know who they are and how they arrived where they are, groups, communities, states and nations need a sense of their own past as part of their culture.
The academic study of history is concerned to discover as much as possible of the reality of the past and to interpret human behaviour in its changes through time. It is a unique subject, scientific in the way it uses evidence, but still an art because the reconstruction of the past requires a disciplined imagination and an effective rhetoric for the communication of meaning.
The contemporary world is one of intensive specialization, in which the varieties of human knowledge have increased well beyond the capacity of any individual to command them all. These developments have reinforced the role of history as the foundation of a person’s education, because history can never exclude any branch of human knowledge, although individual historians will want to select that portion of it especially relevant for them. History’s field of study will always be the entirety of the human experience.
The subject of history does not have a monolithic body of knowledge. Historical understanding is a matter of interpretation, of offering explanations for events and movements which are subject to constant revision by scholars. Arguments, scepticism and controversy are thus the very stuff of history. The history student does not merely acquire a particular mass of information, but learns to think independently.
Especially in the 3000 and 4000 level courses, students gain more than sophistication about substantive areas of history. They also develop transferable skills for oral and written communication, for presentations of findings to groups, for group and independent research, for computer literacy in the human sciences, for research skills in primary and secondary materials, and for the application of foreign languages.
A degree in history provides a superb background for students planning to enter professional careers in fields such as law, education and journalism, as well as those interested in pursuing graduate study in history or related social science and humanities disciplines.
Degree Programs
All BA programs are governed by the general requirements of the College of Arts and Science for degrees, as set out in the University Calendar. See the Degree Requirements section for complete details, particularly with respect to Distribution Requirements, the Writing Course, the Language Course, and Arts and Science Electives. Before registering for the second year, each student in the College of Arts and Science must declare a subject of
 817
 
concentration. Once a student has declared History as the subject of concentration the following degree programs apply.
Courses in the History Department are grouped numerically in several geographical, chronological, subject and other areas: for example, Canadian, American, British, African, Medieval and Early Modern European, Modern European, Science and Technology, etc. Students are strongly encouraged to select a distribution of courses from different areas in order to experience the variety and richness of history.
However, students planning to take a minimum of 30 credit hours in History (above the 1000 level) are required to choose at least three credit hours above the 1000 level in each of four categories (A, B, C and D). See details under History Degree Requirements.
Students who wish to build up a greater specialization in history than the minimum requirements outlined below may do so by taking courses of an historical nature given by the Departments of Classics, Economics, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, Spanish and Latin American Studies, Theatre, etc.
History students interested in obtaining an Emphasis in Canadian Studies along with their Major or Minor in History should consult the Canadian Studies calendar entry for information on requirements and for a list of History courses approved with Canadian Studies.
Students who wish to concentrate in a particular area of history should acquire the appropriate language skills, especially if they intend to pursue graduate study in it.
The following outline presents the MINIMUM departmental requirements for each program and should be read in conjunction with the general requirements of the Faculty.
(Note: This requirement applies to students who start their BA degree in Fall 2014 and after.

Types of Courses
1000 level courses take broad geographic or thematic perspectives over long periods of history to provide a background to many subsequent History courses. 2000 level courses typically deal with countries and transnational regions over a couple of centuries. 1000 level courses assume no prior university-equivalent preparation; second- year courses assume that students have the skills typically developed in the first year of university study. At the
 824
 
1000 and 2000 levels, courses are usually lecture format, three hours per week, with tutorials featured in some courses. 2000 level courses begin more specialized study of an area of History as a major or minor.
3000 and 4000 level courses provide opportunities for the intensive pursuit of interests developed in previous courses. The relatively small size of 3000 level courses (usually 30 students) allows intensive discussion of demanding primary materials and secondary publications, as well as students’ presentation of their independent work. 4000 level courses are taught in a seminar format to cultivate students’ independent research skills; undergraduate enrolments are limited to 15 or less; some are cross-listed as graduate courses. These courses are particularly recommended for Honours students and prospective Honours students.

Courses
Below you will find descriptions for courses offered in this field of study. You will find a general overview of the topics covered and any prerequisite course or grade requirements, credit value and exclusions.
The first digit of the course indicates the general level. Those in the 1000 series are introductory degree level. Courses at the 2000, 3000, 4000 series are typically available to students in the second, third, and fourth year. Courses numbered at the 5000 level or above are graduate level. Courses listed at the 0100 or 0200 series are technology level courses. Courses below the 0100 level are generally non credit courses.
Some courses are listed as exclusionary to one another. This means that students may not obtain credit for both courses as designated.
Not all courses are offered each year. Please consult the current timetable for this year’s offering. For further information please contact the department, or visit the department's website.

HIST 1501 Comparative Global History
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Global history — the study of change over long spans of time and large areas — allows us to examine questions not easily recognized in history conducted on smaller scales. Many aspects of the contemporary world can be understood in revealing ways when approached though a global lens. This course examines a selection of global historical themes each year to understand the broad stories and patterns of change which have shaped our world. Some years this course will trace such global narratives as the histories of capitalism, slavery, or colonialism to explore ways in which the world has become connected. Some years it will examine important themes in global history which our typical focus on the current West-dominated capitalist system obscure, such as the Chinese and Mongol empires or the Islamic world system.

HIST 1502 Origins of Modern Global Society: Non-Writing Requirement
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The contemporary world is both intricately connected and intensely confusing. To make some sense of the global stage on which we now live, historians have recently redoubled their efforts to explore the development of these connections, especially since the eighteenth century. This course follows some of these explorations, attempting to understand the nature and impact of Europe's economic expansion, and how diverse cultures around the world experienced modern social and economic forces. Understanding the complex flows of such things as nationalist ideas, labour migrations, disease epidemics, and imperial control helps reveal the ties which bind us together.

HIST 1503 Comparative Global History
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Global history — the study of change over long spans of time and large areas — allows us to examine questions not easily recognized in history conducted on smaller scales. The world order familiar to us — dominated by “the West” and organized by capitalist relations — contains elements both ancient and new. By comparing different cultural zones in historical periods before Europe’s global dominance in the nineteenth century, this course will explore the diverse ways different cultures met the challenges of survival, and how patterns of connection and domination were made and unmade. Select themes — including trade, transportation, ecology, and state formation — will be used to highlight pre-modern patterns of connection across the globe.

HIST 1510 The History of the Future: How Visions of the Future Have Shaped History Around the World
CREDIT HOURS: 6
Climate change, among other prospects, clouds our future. But visions of the future have bewitched, enchanted, and troubled human dreams for millennia. This class explores diverse moments of doubt, desire and dread across global history when oracles, artists, believers and popular leaders projected hopes and fears into near and distant futures. It explores how prophecies of the world's end reordered the world instead, how promises of impending perfection sometimes generated quite opposite results. This class asks how the future is used to shape the present.

HIST 2208 Patriots, Rebels, Refugees: Canada’s Roots in the Age of Revolution, 1763 to 1860 836
  
CREDIT HOURS: 3
As empires continued their international contest and Britain fought to maintain colonies within North America, old and new inhabitants of what would become Canada also wrestled with questions concerning who would exercise power within their communities and governing bodies. In the process they gave new and, at times, conflicting answers to old questions: What did it mean to be a patriot? Who and what were they willing to defend? Who and what were they prepared to resist? Immigrants, exiles and the refugees of European and North American wars shaped new homelands, even as the First Nations peoples became refugees within their own lands. In this course we explore the related questions of loyalty and conscience through the diaries and letters of men and women defining their place in a new order.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
Do African Nova Scotians constitute a distinct people? This course provides an historical survey of the Black population in Nova Scotia, from its origins through to the present. Treating the people of African descent in Nova Scotia as a particular aspect of the broader African diaspora, we will examine the African Nova Scotian experience in both local and global contexts. The central tenet of the course is that the history of the Black population is an integral component of the region's history: neither can be understood in isolation from the other. A recurring theme is the active and conscious historical agency of African Nova Scotians in the struggle to assert their democratic rights and achieve self-determination.

HIST 2711 Struggles that Shaped the Modern World: 1600-1900
CREDIT HOURS: 3
European expansion from the 16th century reshaped the global economy, obliging many established societies to confront new challenges. Throughout Asia, the New World and Africa, old conflicts between and within states now had to confront the additional challenge of increasingly powerful European intruders. These encounters, and how historians have understood their struggles, shaped the modern world as diverse groups struggled to pursue their interests through resistance, accommodation, coercion, cooperation and
 845
 
alliance. This course will explore the ways in which select societies navigated these encounters to better understand the intricate patterns of linkage and division that mark our world in modern times.

HIST 2714 Slavery and Slaving in Global History
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Slavery was a powerful and widespread part of human history long before it became embedded in the Atlantic world. People continue to be enslaved today. This course will look at slavery from ancient to contemporary times in diverse parts of the world to better understand what slavery is, why it is so common, why it takes different forms, and how it has been resisted. Many historians approach this study by dividing societies into those dependent on slave labour, and those merely holding slaves. Other historians are more interested in the situations and processes which give rise to slaving systems, how power is negotiated within them, and how both slaves and masters have shaped diverse slaving orders. This class combines both approaches, looking first at the sophisticated understandings of slavery historians have developed for the ancient Mediterranean, then exploring more recent scholarship about the varieties of slavery in Asia and Africa. The last part of the class will look at slavery in the Atlantic world and contemporary times considering what we have learned about slavery and the fights against it elsewhere

The class will provide a broad historical overview of incarceration as it has been practiced and experienced internationally. We will consider the development of various forms of incarceration as the dominant form of punishment in the modern world. Prison systems have their roots in Europe, but the systematic practice of incarceration was exported to all corners of the globe as a key imperial and colonial construct. In our exploration of carceral practices and institutions across a range of settings and time periods, we will examine the birth of the modern prison; various theories and philosophies that have informed penal practices; penal transportation; colonial models of imprisonment; various reform movements; intersections between race, class and incarceration; political imprisonment; prison cultures; prisons as business; different national approaches to incarceration; and alternatives to mass imprisonment.

HIST 3051 Fascist and National Socialist Movements in Europe, 1900-1945

Fascism remains one of the most misunderstood and intriguing curiosities of modern history.

HIST 3085 The Many Faces of Frederic Chopin: Problems in Modern Biography
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The seminar examines the process of creating biographical representations in history by focusing on Frederic Chopin (1810–1849) and the appropriations of his life, personality and music, that occurred both during his lifetime and after his death. By analyzing how Chopin’s images were construed—and the manner in which he fashioned himself—the course explores broader themes, such as biography in historical writing, the nineteenth-century paradigm of biography writing, politics of biography, biography and the construction of the subject, biography as a control of cultural memory and the limits of biographical knowledge.

This course explores the nature and development of the English criminal justice system during the period in which it first began to be exported to other areas, and at home had to deal with the turmoil wrought by reformation, war, and industrialization. It examines the historical development and social uses of the criminal law. We will explore such questions as whether the law acted in the interests of particular people or groups, and if so, how? Did it serve to enforce and legitimize social and economic structures? Classes will progress thematically rather than chronologically; some will be devoted to a particular type of punishment, some to the different groups of people involved in the legal process; and others to scholarly debates on the subject.

HIST 3107 The English Family and Household
CREDIT HOURS: 3
A number of commentators believe that "the family" is in crisis, its stability threatened by declining marriage rates, rising levels of divorce and single parenthood, and the emergence of alternative family forms. But what does the phrase "the family" actually mean? This course ponders the origins of the modern Western family by tracing the history of household organization, family and sexual relations in England between 1500 and 1800. Historians' attempts to define the family and to identify shifts in patterns of family life over time have often sparked controversy, as those who advocate grand explanatory narratives of change have had their views challenged by others who emphasize continuity and complexity. This course will analyze and assess these ongoing debates while encouraging students to make their own contributions through a careful reading of diaries, autobiographical writings, published court records, plays and other primary source materials.

The “long sixties” – a period from the mid-fifties through the early seventies – was an extraordinary time in American history when a number of different groups attempted to transform American society. In many ways they were successful, and we are still living with the legacy of the sixties today. This course is designed to introduce students to the numerous issues, conflicts, and problems that confronted Americans in the 1960s. The course will focus on the various movements of social reform that characterized this period. We will also discuss the rise of the “new left” and the “new right” and what these ideological movements meant for American political culture. The overall goal of the course is to encourage students to think about how individuals adjust their values to fit a particular
 861
 
political and cultural climate. Why do some people conform to political and social values, while others do not? Students will come at these questions from a variety of perspectives. Art, film, fiction, and music will be used throughout the course.

HIST 3380 Slavery and Freedom in the Americas
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course will take a broad perspective on slavery by examining some of the defining features of forced labor throughout the Americas over the course of four centuries (with occasional examples from elsewhere in the world). To complicate the overly simplistic slave-free dichotomy and develop a more nuanced understanding of the denial of freedom, we will investigate not only chattel slavery but other systems of free and unfree labor that existed in the Americas, such as the encomienda, convict labor, debt bondage, serfdom, pauper apprenticeship, poorhouse and prison work, indentured servitude and wage labor. We will consider definitions and justifications of slavery (including racist ideology) that have been used by past and present theorists. To better understand the extent to which the working environment shaped the lives of the enslaved, we will compare the living and working conditions of laborers in a range of historical settings. We will conclude with a survey of the rise of free labor ideology, the impact of emancipation in the Americas and a glance at forced and free labor systems in the new millennium.

It will conclude by examining how this world was changed by the dismantling of the slave system and the age of revolutions.

HIST 3430 The Making of Colonial Africa, c 1850 - 1930
CREDIT HOURS: 3
European colonial rulers and business interests laid out the framework of the sub-Saharan African colonial order from about 1850 to the 1920s, seeking ways to exploit African labour and natural resources. But imperial plans were limited and sometimes frustrated by African interests, and by historical dynamics within Africa, such as the rise of new merchants and Islamic revolution. This course assesses how the realities of Africa intersected with European imperial ambitions to profoundly change African society during this early colonial period.

HIST 3431 Struggles in The City: Labour, Migration and Urban Life in Colonial Africa
CREDIT HOURS: 3
There were many important urban centres in pre-colonial Africa; however, colonialism and industrialization changed both the pace and nature of urbanization. Old cities grew and new cities and mining settlements were established. Africans came to labour in these colonial cities for a host of reasons - some were forced off their homesteads when settlers and colonial governments appropriated vast tracts of land, others needed to enter the cash economy to pay colonial taxes; women and men sought new opportunities and adventure. This movement to the cities transformed the lives of millions of Africans. This course will focus on the lives of these urban dwellers, the development of urban cultures, the gendered character of urbanization, the creation of new social, political, economic and criminal networks, conflict and cooperation amongst urbanites, and the nature of colonial oppression and control in the cities.

HIST 3435 The Rise and Fall of African Slavery
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Many African societies, like pre-industrial societies elsewhere, used slaves as well as other forms of labour for a variety of purposes. The rise of external slave trades after 1700 — notably across the Atlantic and Sahara — transformed many African societies into specialized slave exporters. As external slave trades declined in the 19th century, many African economies used extensive internal slave labour to produce exports, a pattern colonial governments were slow to change in the 20th century. This course examines these changes in African slavery, and how they affected such issues as gender relations and class structure.

HIST 3470 Wars and Revolutions in Nineteenth-Century Africa
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Africa in the nineteenth century was profoundly reshaped by a complex set of events. Muhammed Ali undertook to modernize Egypt. New Islamic states founded in the west developed plantation economies of unrivaled size. On the Atlantic coast, merchant princes made their fortunes supplying tropical goods for Europe's Industrial Revolution. In Central Africa the search for slaves and ivory both wreaked havoc and stimulated new states. In the south, the rise of Zulu power generated waves of conquest and consolidation. This course assesses the extent to which Africa was reshaped in the revolutionary century before colonial partition.

HIST 3509 Arab Caliphs, Turkish Commanders, and Persian Viziers: Islamic History, 750-1200
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The focus of this course will be the different manifestations of Islamic civilization as it reached its zenith under a series of caliphates and sultanates across Spain, North Africa, the Levant, Iran, Central Asia, and South Asia between 750 and 1400. Emphasis will be placed on the role of heterodoxy and the emergence of numerous Islamic communities and movements (shi`ites, Sufis) as the `Abbasid empire (750-1258) struggled to maintain political and doctrinal unity. There will also be a discussion of the Turkic migrations and the corresponding rise in Turkic Islamic sultanates such as the Saljuqs and the Ghaznavids in the East, and how such developments were mirrored by the establishment of a number of Crusader states in the Holy Land. Lastly, we will examine the invasions by the Mongol khans and their devastating effect on the central Islamic world. This course will also discuss the incorporation of Hellenistic culture during the Abbasid period and the rise of Mutazilite (‘rationalist’) thought, notably in physical sciences, political studies, and
 865
 
philosophy, and how such syncretism was also reflected in terms of mysticism, art, architecture, and literature in the East as Islamic culture interacted with Zoroastrian, Buddhist and Hindu culture in Iran, Central Asia, and India.

HIST 3510 Sultans and Shahs: Politics and Religion in the Islamic Gunpowder Age (1500 - 1800)
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Until the devastating Mongol invasions of the 13th century, the principal centers of Islamic power, culture, and thought had been based in Cairo and Baghdad. This course will examine the post-Mongol Islamic world, and how politics and religion were irrevocably changed with the annihilation of the Sunni Abbasid caliphate. Religious heterodoxy, combined with the power vacuum left by Chingiz Khan and his descendents, allowed for the emergence of a number of unique Turkmen states in Western Asia, the most famous being the Ottoman Turks of Anatolia. By 1500, innovations in military technology and the paper-making industry allowed for the emergence of centralized and bureaucratically-sophisticated 'gunpowder' empires in western and south Asia. This course will discuss the three most significant of these: the Ottoman Turks (based in Istanbul), the Safavid Persians (based in Isfahan), and the Mughal Indians (based in Delhi). Areas of focus will include: issues of political legitimacy, use of military 'slave' corps, orthodox and popular religious movements, tensions between nomadic and sedentary segments of society, innovations in cultural expression (poetry, art, architecture), scientific and philosophical development, and the penetration and impact of the Portuguese, English, Dutch, and French 'world economies' into Asia and the Indian Ocean. This course will also examine different debates regarding the 'decline of the East', and introduce the theoretical implications of how the Islamic world is approached by contemporary scholarship.

HIST 3511 Ancient and Medieval History of the Persianate World
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course is dedicated to studying those periods from antiquity to the medieval age where parts of Asia were influenced and defined by the Persian language and culture (i.e. Iran, the Caucasus, the Steppe, Mesopotamia, Central Asia, Anatolia, South Asia). This course will begin with examining the Aryan invasions of the 2nd Millenium B.C.E., and the eventual establishment of the Median and Achaemenid empires in the 7th – 6th centuries B.C.E. The Persian Wars between the Persians and the Greeks, culminating with Alexander the Great’s invasion and the establishment of a Perso-Hellenistic state in the 4th century B.C.E. will be studied along with various issues associated with ancient Iran and Central Asia (Zoroastrianism, Manicheanism, Nestorian Christianity, Buddhism) during the Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian periods. This course will also examine the impact of the Arab Muslim invasions on Iran and Central Asia in the 7th, 8th, and 9th centuries, and the contribution of Persian civilization to the growth and success of Islam during the Abbasid period (750-1258). Strong emphasis will be placed on examining various aspects of Persianate culture, namely poetry, literature, art, architecture, philosophy, and mysticism in the medieval period.

Particular focus will be placed on Reza Shah's monarchy, and the implications of the Revolution in 1979, not only in Iran, but throughout Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Gulf Region. This course will continue with the impact of the Islamic Republic of Iran in terms of the Iranian culture, religion and politics.

HIST 3520 Empire, War, and Resistance in Sri Lanka
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The official birth of the British Raj in South Asia is conventionally dated to 1857, following a rebellion of Indian soldiers working for the British East India Company. But the antecedents of the British Raj arguably have its roots in the island of Ceylon, more than half a century earlier. In this class, we will challenge the thesis that the Raj begins in India by studying the dynamics of empire, war, and resistance on the small island state of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in the Indian Ocean. No prior knowledge of the region is required, this course is meant to introduce students to the global history, politics, and conflicts that contoured the development of modern/colonial Ceylon, known today as “Sri Lanka.” We focus on the imperial conflicts that defined the period of British colonial rule (1802 – 1948), but towards the end of the class, emphasize how these historical events continue to impact post-colonial Sri Lanka in terms of ethnonationalist strife and Asian geopolitics. In so doing, part of the conceptual work of this course is to draw into contention the stability with which we think of the term “post” colonial in terms of states within the former British empire.

HIST 4303 The Birth of Pop: How Visual Culture Makes Meaning
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Contemporary western society is saturated with visual images of all kinds: from oil painting to pornography. Visual culture is not only becoming more diverse but also increasingly globalized. For these reasons alone, the study of popular visual culture is an important pursuit. But popular images, like all visual images, also carry meaning and generate effects. The first part of this course explores the origins of mass popular culture in 19th Century Britain. Through case studies, suggesting that Western ideas about mental health, gender, romance, weddings and marriage emerged and were transmitted though Victorian visual culture, students learn to see connections between the popular culture of the past and contemporary visuality. Students will also critique the development of cultural studies as a discipline and form their own theoretical positions. In the second part, students will conduct their own self- directed primary research into a visual popular culture topic of their choosing. In the final weeks of the course, students will be asked to reflect on the course as a whole, consolidate what they have learned, and articulate the connections (or disruptions) they see between historical and contemporary theory and practice. This course is ideally suited to students who want to incorporate visual or

HIST 4355 Becoming the State
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The state is undeniably the central “agent” of the modern global system, yet explanations for the emergence of the state as the hegemonic mode of organizing human society tend to privilege Eurocentric histories, obfuscating the different ways of organizing space that have existed around our shared planet. Consequently, the inter-state system itself that constitutes the ‘terrain’ of modern global studies remains only partially historicized. In this seminar, we study the emergence of the modern territorial state with attention to the tensions that emerge when distinct modes of organizing space encounter one another in the modern, colonial era. We begin surveying methods and approaches for studying the state, then move into geographic case studies and critical problems emerging from the rise of the state as a creature of the modern, colonial encounter.

We will explore the meaning of the revolution and American independence for various groups of people in the colonies, including colonial elites, women, Native Americans and African- Americans. We will also examine the Loyalists and the Loyalist diaspora. Throughout the course we will try to determine how revolutionary or radical this event was.

HIST 4475 African Intellectuals and the Modern Experience
CREDIT HOURS: 3
African thinkers have long pondered the challenges of the modern era, and have established lines of thought with which African intellectuals now address Africa's profound problems. But this engagement with the modern world has moved through different phases, just as the social location of the African intelligentsia has changed over time. This course will explore this intellectual history by setting specific writers in context, and then examining their original writings to ponder such questions as: What were the roots of “African Christianity”? How did African intellectuals respond to “scientific” racism? What was the appeal of Pan-Africanism? What was Negritude? How socialist was African socialism? How do postmodern insights about the invention of identity affect the idea of being “African”?

HIST 4545 Scripture and Statecraft: History of Islamic Political Thought
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course is dedicated to understanding how Arab-centric tribal relations and networks initially defined Islamic politics in 7th-century Arabia, and how these definitions were later influenced by external 'imperial' and 'kingly' traditions (from Byzantines, Iranians, Indians). Muslim concepts of authority, however, were and still are defined by prophetic genealogies and charisma, and parts of this course will examine the shi`ite doctrine of imamate and the growth of millenarian thought. This course will also focus on the changes in political philosophy as a result of the violent arrival of the Mongols, and how traditional sunni notions of authority and state were displaced by the rise of Shi`ism and Sufism. Discussions will also focus on Muhammad ibn `Abd al-Wahhab and Jamal al-Din al- Afghani and the extent to which Islamic political thought retooled and reappraised in the wake of European hegemonic imperialism. The remainder of the course will examine the rise of Islamism, its radicalization following World War Two, and the implications of Islamism and its opponents against the backdrop of the Islamic Revolution in Iran and other religio-political movements in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.

HIST 4550 Orientalism and Occidentalism
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This seminar is intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students interested in discussing how scholarship has historically
 874
 
approached non-Western and non-Christian areas of the globe. Dating back to Herodotus, Plato, and Isocrates, the description of "the Other" has been a consistent theme in European literary and academic traditions. Whether or not it was the apologetic theological rivalry between Islam and Christianity in the Middle Ages, or the Humanist mania for non-European languages and ethnography, Occidental scholarship has historically been attracted to understanding and depicting the non-Occident. This course will examine the different European intellectual traditions of early modern Europe and how they laid the foundation for subsequent 19th and early 20th century characterizations of the Islamic world. Concurrently, however, there is evidence that a discourse of "Occidentalism" emerged among Muslim scholars and literati, and the ensuing dialectic between West and East framed the introduction of a number of political and religious ideologies to the Middle East, Iran, Central Asia, and India. There will be readings and discussions of a number of different scholars and theorists - Foucault, Chakrabarty, Said - who have commented on these discourses. Equal attention will be given to those Muslim scholars - Shayaghan, Soroush, al-Ahmad - who have written and commented on these dynamics between Western and Islamic civilization.

HIST 4980 Reading and Writing 'Postmodern' 'History'
CREDIT HOURS: 3
According to a number of post-modern theorists we have now reached the “end of history.” History, they argue, as it is now taught at Dalhousie University, and many other universities around the world, is a dead or dying field of study of study. Taking this assumption as

a starting point this course is designed to explore what alternative accounts of the “before now” could look like. The course itself consists of three parts. The first part will concentrate on some of the key ideas behind “postmodern” theory. In the second part we will examine various historical studies written by both modern and postmodern historians in order understand the differences between the two interpretive approaches. In the third part of the course you will have the opportunity to write and present your own papers on the before now. You will do so by participating in an act of intellectual disobedience whereby you will reject many of the current rules of writing history in order to create your own "uncompromising, emancipatory message.

 History of Science and Technology Program
 878

Science and technology shape who we are, our environments, our conditions of work and play, and what we consider to be trustworthy knowledge. The History of Science and Technology (HOST) program explores the historical, cultural, social, religious, and philosophical contexts of this engagement to elucidate the nature of scientific knowledge and to understand the role of science and technology in the development of past and present societies.
HOST is an interdisciplinary program that cuts across the sciences and the humanities. Our courses explore topics as diverse as the ancient origins of technology, medieval natural philosophy, alchemy and magic, the Scientific Revolution, science in movies and literature, and how modern science is, every day, influencing and transforming our political, social, religious, cultural, and economic institutions.
HOST courses are open to any student registered either at Dalhousie University or the University of King’s College. We also welcome visiting students (attending on a Letter of Permission) from other universities.
Degree Options
Students registered in the BA or BSc degree at either King’s or Dalhousie have two options for pursuing a degree in the HOST program: (a) the Combined Honours degree or (b) the Minor.

Combined Honours
Pursuing an honours degree requires a higher quality of work than is required by the other undergraduate programs (such as a 120 credit hours Major). Students who intend to apply to graduate school or professional programmes (e.g. medicine or law) are especially encouraged to take a Honours degree as scholarships and program committees tend to look more favourably on students with Honours-level degrees. Choosing a Combined Honours degree enables you to pursue your studies in two disciplines, while demonstrating your seriousness and abilities as a student.
 879
 
The HOST Combined Honours degree is available to students pursuing a BA, a BSc, or a Bachelor of Journalism. The Combined Honours BA or BSc degree in HOST is offered jointly by Dalhousie University and the University of King’s College.
The Dalhousie departmental offerings within the History of Science and Technology Program may include the other honours subject, a number of possible electives, and certain cross-listed courses. The other honours subject must be selected from the following list of Dalhousie departments and programs: Canadian Studies, Cinema and Media Studies, Classics, Creative Writing, English, Environment, Sustainability and Society, Environmental Science, French, Gender and Women’s Studies, German, History, International Development Studies, Law, Justice and Society, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, Religious Studies, Russian Studies, Sociology, Social Anthropology, Spanish and Latin American Studies, Theatre, Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computing Science, Earth Sciences, Economics, Marine Biology, Mathematics, Microbiology and Immunology, Neuroscience, Oceanography, Physics, Psychology, and Statistics.
Students are encouraged to apply to the program and seek advice on course selection as early as possible, even before registering for the second year. All students must meet the degree requirements for the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences or Faculty of Science program as detailed in the Degree Requirements section of this calendar. For each individual student, the entire degree program, including elective courses and honours requirements, is subject to supervision and approval by the two concerned programs.
All History of Science and Technology students are encouraged to acquire (through appropriate courses) competence in languages which are relevant to their degree, interests and future plans.
The joint Dalhousie/King’s History of Science and Technology Combined Honours Program is based on the general requirement that the full credits needed to graduate include:
1. In the case of a Combined Honours BSc degree, a minimum of 66 and a maximum of 84 credit hours beyond the 1000 level in the two honours subjects, but not more than 54 and no fewer than 30 credit hours being in either of them. Students may elect to complete only 24 credit hours in HSTC, but require prior program's approval to do so. The larger number of honours credit hours must be in the science subject.
In the case of a Combined Honours BA degree, a minimum of 66 and a maximum of 84 credit hours beyond the 1000 level in the two honours subjects, with no more than 48 and no fewer than 30 credit hours in either.
2. Six (6) to twenty-four (24) elective credit hours, depending on the number selected in the honours subject.
3. 12 credit hours of "core" courses in history of science: HSTC 2001.03: Ancient and Medieval Science, HSTC 3001.03: Scientific Revolution, HSTC 4001.03: Modern Science, HSTC 4600: Historiography Seminar (or their equivalent). (With special permission from the Program Director HSTC 3030.06 or HSTC 3031.03/HSTC 3032.03 may be substituted for one of these four core courses).
4. An honours qualifying examination (see Degree Requirement: BA, BSc Combined Honours (4 Year). BSc students must acquire this additional grade in their science subject. BA students may choose to acquire this additional grade in either honours subject with the approval of both units. In the History of Science and Technology Program, the honours thesis (HSTC 4650.03) fulfills the requirement of the honours qualifying examination.
Students will be eligible to take an "Independent Reading" course only when they reach their third or fourth year. The permission of a member of the teaching staff and the Director of the Program is necessary in order to take one of these courses, and their availability is strictly limited.
Minor in History of Science and Technology
This minor is available to students registered in a 120 credit hour Bachelor of Applied Computer Science, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Community Design, Bachelor of Computer Science, Bachelor of

HSTC 2002 Medieval Natural Philosophy: From the Roman Empire to the Age of Dante
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course introduces key developments in medieval understandings of nature (better called "natural philosophy" than "science") through a direct engagement with primary sources. We consider how the texts and authorities of antiquity (Plato and Aristotle, most notably) were assimilated, adapted, and transformed during the Roman Empire, in Islam, and in later medieval Christian Europe. Questions such as the role of ‘nature’ in defining human happiness, the good life, and the character of political power will figure prominently. We will attend to the limits of ‘natural’ reason in relation to established disciplines like theology, as well as more contested areas of knowledge such as magic, astrology and alchemy. The approach taken will be that of intellectual history, in the sense that we will focus on fundamental concepts articulated by the authors and on careful textual exegesis, while always attentive to the wider historical and cultural contexts. Especially given that this course's authors, texts, and contexts are quite distant in time from our contemporary world, there will also be occasions for us to reflect on the challenges facing the modern inquirer into pre-modern conceptions of nature and scientific knowledge.

HSTC 2120 Magic, Science and the Occult: from Antiquity to Postmodernity
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The 'scientific revolution' is ordinarily construed as the triumph of reason over superstition, of science over sorcery. This course argues that the rhetoric of 'enlightenment' conceals a deep continuity between Modern science and the occult traditions of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The prototype of the experimental scientist is the Faustian magus. We investigate the role of Hermeticism, magic and the occult in the scientific revolution and the persistence of these esoteric currents in later movements, from German Naturphilosophie to Jungian psychology.

HSTC 2310 Women and Gender in Early Modern Science
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course will explore the roles of women, and questions about women’s nature, in the development of Early Modern science. The course will consider several interrelated aspects of scientific culture in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries: first, we will look at the place of women in the scientific institutions of the time. The second part of the course will look at the contributions of some particular women to the fields of physics, astronomy, botany, and medicine. We will then examine how science interpreted sex and gender. Finally, the course will explore the ways in which gender and nature were portrayed in the broader cultural context. We will, for example, discuss the ways in which women were depicted as scientists and as symbols of science in art and literature. CALENDAR NOTES:

HSTC 2340 The Origins of Science Fiction in Early Modern Europe
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In 1500, literate Europeans lived in a bounded, geocentric universe. By 1800, the sun had replaced the earth at the centre of a limited planetary system situated in infinite space. These changes prompted early modern philosophers, scientists and writers to consider the possibility that the universe might contain a plurality of worlds. This course will explore the ways in which the “plurality” theme was developed in some of the earliest works of science fiction. We will consider this theme as it appears in stories of intergalactic voyages, utopian societies, and encounters with extraterrestrial beings, paying special attention to the ways in which early modern writers used these tales to speculate on philosophical, political, and scientific issues.

HSTC 2400 Science and the Media
CREDIT HOURS: 3
From the first Babylonian astronomical records on cuneiform to the public understanding of science on television, the various media have long been crucial to the success and spread of science. This course provides a history of science in the media from the ancient and medieval use of geometrical diagrams, astronomical figures and anatomical illustration through early modern printed texts, popular broadsheets and color botanical plates all the way to the ubiquity of science in literature, cinema and on the Internet. This expanding presence of science in the media is examined against the backdrop of three revolutions: literary and artistic (ancient and medieval worlds), mechanical (early modern period) and electronic (contemporary age). Specific themes considered include the increasing accuracy of scientific illustration, the rise of scientific journals, public scientific demonstrations, science in poetry and prose fiction, science and art, radio and television documentaries, the advertising and marketing of science, scientific apocalypses and techno- utopias, bioethics, Soviet era technological iconography, environmentalism and science-religion relations in the journalistic press, science fiction from H.G. Wells’ War of the Worlds to Star Wars and Jurassic Park, and science in computing and cyberspace. CALENDAR NOTES:

HSTC 3120 Distilling Nature's Secrets: The Ancient Alchemists
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course explores the scientific and esoteric currents which contributed to the rise of alchemy in the late Ancient World. This 'sacred science' of transmutation was a cultural synthesis of Greek natural philosophy, late pagan mysticism, and Near Eastern metallurgic technologies. The physical processes enacted in the alchemical laboratory -where metals were decomposed, purified and transformed - were experienced inwardly by the alchemist himself as a spiritual drama of death and resurrection, analogous to the rites of initiation in the mystery cults. Alchemy was thus a form of ritual technology, aimed simultaneously at the purification of self and cosmos. The texts studied in the course range from technical manuals preserved on papyrus, to the highly esoteric and visionary works of the Hermetic philosopher Zosimos (circa 300CE). The relation between these technical and occult dimensions will be of central concern.

 891
 
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Beginning with an overview of the history and methodology of the study of science and religion, encounters between science and religion are traced from the dawn of civilization to the end of the eighteenth century, with a special focus on the early modern period. From an examination of the biblical view of nature, ancient Babylonian astrology and divination and Plato's Timaeus, this course moves through a treatment of the centrality of theology to Medieval science on to natural theology and the “Watchmaker” Design Argument of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Models of conflict, harmony and complementarity offered to characterize relations between science and religion are explored through case studies such as Galileo’s controversy with the Church and instances where religious belief inspired scientists like Boyle and Newton. Claims that certain confessional traditions (notably Protestantism and its dissenting offshoots) facilitated the rise of modern science are also appraised. Science-religion relations are examined both from the standpoint of mainstream religion and with respect to religious heterodoxy, prophecy, alchemy, magic and witchcraft. This course employs examples from Islamic cultures in addition to the Judeo-Christian tradition. Special features include a focus on primary texts and guest lectures by scientists.

Beginning with an overview of the history and methodology of the study of science and religion, encounters between science and religion are traced from the rise of Darwinism in the early nineteenth century to the contemporary postmodern age. From an examination of nineteenth-century “Scriptural geology” and the religious impact of Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859), this course moves on to such contemporary topics as the religious interpretations of quantum mechanics, the Big Bang, the anthropic principle, medical science, bioethics, evolutionary psychology, chaos theory, aesthetics in nature, science fiction, extra-terrestrial life (including the SETI Project) and the quest for technoimmortality. Case studies of “conflict” emanating from Darwinism, the Scopes Trial, the on- going Creation-Evolution debates and the New Atheism are contrasted with examples of harmony and interdependence between science and religion in the careers of modern scientists, along with phenomena like the new Intelligent Design (ID) movement. The religious scope of the course is intentionally wide-ranging, and examinations of science-religion interaction within Native American, African and New Age spirituality are added to treatments of traditional eastern and western religion.

In the history of western thought, mathematics has had a central place. Its own history has "internal" aspects, characterised by a cumulative development of great and greater complexity and a proliferation of powerful methods for solving problems which mathematics generated from within itself, and which thereby gradually transformed its very nature. However, this class will seek to regard such "internal" aspects in the context of their place within and their contribution to broader philosophical inquiries and to conceptions of how the natural world is know. Central "moments" in the history will be featured, beginning with ancient Greek mathematics through to the development of non-Euclidean geometry in the 19th Century and beyond.

Einstein's elevator, Schrodinger's cat, Maxwell's demon; the history of physics is full of these instructive fictions that are thought experiments. This course examines the historical contexts of many thought experiments in order to understand the different roles they have played in the conceptual development of physics from Antiquity to the present.

HSTC 3501 The Nature of Time I
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course will consider views of time beginning with Mesopotamian notions of narrative, Egyptian conceptions, and the encounter between linear and circular time in Judaic thought. The vision of Greece will be brought out through epic narration, in Pre-Socratic thought, in Greek historical texts. The course will treat some central texts, in Plato on the concept of time in the soul, in Aristotle, where time becomes the measure of motion, in the willed totality in Stoic and Epicurean thought, in Plotinus, where time is grounded in a pretemporal duration. The course will then take up the relation of this duration and time to revelation, creation and conversion in Medieval Christian, Islamic and Jewish thought.

Through the close reading of one selected ancient work, this course seeks to explore fundamental problems in ancient natural philosophy, such as: How did the ancients see the validity of their approaches to the natural world? What sorts of phenomena were seen as “natural” in antiquity? What are the limitations to textual evidence for ancient science? How did theories about the natural world inform how the ancients saw their place in the Cosmos? How did ancient social values affect views of nature?

This half-year course will explore the history, structure and associated problems of our coming to be technological, beginning with an elaboration of the concept of “techne” in the ancients and its modification in the technical arts and instrumental reasoning of the Enlightenment and of 19th-century industrial ideology. Post-Enlightenment critiques polarized around the place of the machine and alienation in Karl Marx and the “question concerning technology” in Martin Heidegger will then be examined, leading up to an examination of the present state of technological discourse. In each case, we shall mark the importance of contextualising the debate by exploring the actual historical evolution of technology. Lectures will be devoted to presenting a social and historical background to the development of modern technologies whilst seminars will focus on the reading of primary texts in the field.

HSTC 4300 Nature and Romanticism
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Kant’s “Copernican Revolution” in philosophy, ironically, marked a resurrection of a full-blown “idealist” philosophy of nature. This course will investigate the attempts of Kant’s followers to construct a natural philosophy and its engagement with the rival mechanical world picture. It explores the implications of this endeavour for the growth of romanticism, vitalism and our modern picture of “nature”. It begins with an examination of the ambiguous heritage presented by Kant’s writings on nature and proceeds through the attempts to develop a complete program of idealist Naturphilosophie and its spread throughout European thought by the medium of romanticist art and natural philosophy.

HSTC 4400 Newton and Newtonianism
 899
 
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This seminar involves a close study of the work of Isaac Newton, along with that of his supporters and detractors. Beginning with an overview of pre-Newtonian science, topics range from Newton’s rejection of Cartesianism through his contributions to mathematics, physics, astronomy and optics, along with his inductive scientific method, laws of motion and calculus priority dispute with Leibniz. Also considered are lesser-known aspects of his career, such as his secretive pursuit of alchemy, his heretical theology, his attempts to unravel the Apocalypse, his role in British statecraft and his autocratic rule of the Royal Society. A taxonomy of the forms of Newtonianism that emerged after Newton’s death also allows an exploration of iconographical and apologetic uses of Newton, and his differing legacies in the Britain and France. This seminar concentrates on primary readings, including Newton’s Principia (1687), Opticks (1704), alchemical treatises and unpublished theological papers, as well as the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence (1717), anti-Newtoniana and eighteenth-century popularizations of Newtonianism such as Voltaire’s Philosophical letters (1733) and Maclaurin’s Account of Newton’s discoveries (1748). Attention is paid to the social, cultural and political aspects of Newtonianism and no prior knowledge of science is required.

 Introduction
International Development Studies is an interdisciplinary program involving the study of poverty, inequality, social change and justice in a global context. The IDS program is structured around two broad axes: development theory/practice, and the global/local. Areas of teaching expertise among the core faculty in IDS include development theory, gender, activism, culture, human security, rural development, migration, health, Indigenous peoples, participatory development and global citizenship. Additional areas of expertise are drawn from over 40 cross-appointed and adjunct faculty members who teach IDS approved courses and/or supervise our honours thesis and graduate students.
The department's areas of expertise include many of the key regions of the developing world, particularly Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. We take a broad view of development - including development issues within Canada as well as the global South.
We offer a diverse set of opportunities for students to participate in experiential learning in both Canadian and international contexts. Experiential learning enables students to focus on skills development in a range of areas: language development, research, writing, managerial, etc. Through our experiential learning opportunities, students can volunteer or intern in Halifax, East Africa, Cuba, and many other locations. Students are encouraged to draw upon international development experiences from overseas linkage programs through Dalhousie and local Halifax community organizations.
The IDS program offers a study abroad option in Cuba (Winter) with FLACSO (Facultad Latino Americana de Ciencias Sociales Program Cuba) in the University of Havana as well as an intensive spring program in Cuba.
As an interdisciplinary program, IDS recommends students consider combined degree programs. Students are therefore encouraged to enter the combined honours, double major or minor programs, which provide opportunities that further integrate their IDS studies with those of an approved arts or science field, e.g. IDS and History, IDS and Biology. Double majors and combined honours degrees provide additional opportunities for students to pursue graduate studies in more than one area.
Students with backgrounds in sciences are also welcome in this program as topics in international development cut across all disciplines from anthropology to animal science.
The interdisciplinary nature of the program requires that students take a number of credits outside the IDS department as IDS approved courses in other departments. The first year of study at Dalhousie is dedicated to
 907
 
completing first year requirements. IDS students are encouraged to take a broad range of disciplines in their first year to prepare them for the interdisciplinary format of the program. First year students are encouraged to participate in numerous student-led organizations related to International Development. Other events and activities are advertised on the IDS website and information can be obtained from the IDS office.
Students are encouraged to acquire competence in a relevant language in addition to English (e.g. Arabic, French, Spanish) and Economics. Research design and basic statistics courses (e.g. POLI 3492/POLI 3493 or SOSA 3402/SOSA 3403) are also useful skills to acquire throughout the IDS degree.
Degree Programs
In addition to the departmental requirements listed below, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Degree Requirements for College of Arts and Science.
The IDS Department offers the following undergraduate degree options:
IDS as the second subject of study
1. Minor in IDS (18 IDS credit hours required)
2. Double Major with IDS as the second subject (30 IDS credit hours required)
3. Combined Honours with IDS as the second subject (30 IDS credit hours required)

2. BA (120 credit hours) Double Major in IDS as the primary subject (30 IDS credit hours required)
3. BA (120 credit hours) Major in IDS (36 IDS credit hours required)
1. BA (120 credit hours) Combined Honours in IDS + a second subject: Thesis stream (42 IDS credit hours required)
2. BA (120 credit hours) Combined Honours in IDS + a second subject: Coursework stream (42 IDS credit hours required)
3. BA (120 credit hours) Concentrated Honours in IDS: Thesis stream - (54 IDS credit hours required)
4. BA (120 credit hours) Concentrated Honours in IDS: Coursework stream - (54 IDS credit hours required)
First Year Recommended Courses
To enter any of the IDS undergraduate degree programs, students should have completed 30 credit hours and are strongly recommended to fulfill the first year requirements outlined in the Degree Requirement section of this calendar.

IDS Honours Program
The IDS Honours program is designed for students with a demonstrated aptitude for advanced study in the field.
• Admission to the IDS Honours program is based on academic performance and, in the case of the thesis stream, a thesis proposal. Applicants normally should have achieved an overall Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 3.30 (B+) or better and a minimum B+/A- in all IDS and IDS-approved courses to be considered for admission. In the case of a combined degree, these same requirements must be met in the second major subject
• The deadline for Departmental Honours Applications is January 31 of a student’s third year of study. Consult the IDS Department website dal.ca/ids for information on how to apply to the honours program.
• For entry into the thesis stream, successful applicants must be registered in both the Fall and Winter Honours Thesis courses, INTD 4401 and INTD 4402. These are two classes that constitute a multi-term course and both must be successfully completed to earn an Honours degree in International Development Studies by way of a thesis. The Thesis courses are restricted to students pursuing the thesis option.

Course Descriptions
INTD 1102 Halifax and the World: Part I
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course offers an introduction to both International Development Studies and Canadian Studies by exploring the connections between important global issues and your daily life as a student in Halifax. As you walk across the Dalhousie campus and go about daily life in Halifax, your actions connect you to people around the globe and to the history of the city and world as well as to the many works of literature, art and music that depict these connections. Here are just a few examples of connections that we will explore in Halifax and the World: Part I (INTD / CANA 1102.03 – Fall semester): Walking across the Dalhousie campus you are traversing what remains unceded Mi'kmaq territory raising hard questions about relations between Settler and First Nations Peoples. While walking downtown on a Friday night you might tread in the footsteps of the central characters in Hugh MacLennan's novel Barometer Rising and other major works of Canadian fiction. As you walk through the city you'll see monuments and statues that commemorate the city's early colonial leaders – which raise questions about how we chose to remember history of the city and its connections to the world.The course will critically examine the connections between daily life in Halifax and broader issues of colonialism, race and class relations, historical memory, ethics and justice through a combination of lectures, guest speakers, discussion groups, field trips, experiential learning in the city of Halifax. Assignments include written reflections on specific sites in Halifax which students are expected to visit and explore, a public engagement project, and a series of quizzes (there is no final exam).

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course builds on INTD/CANA 1102.03 (Halifax and the World: Part I) with a continued focus on the connections between important global issues and your daily life as a student in Halifax. In the winter semester, the course will focus on connections between life in Halifax and global development issues in other parts of the world. In particular, the course will highlight the ‘commodity chains' that connect our daily consumption decisions to other people around the world who are involved in the life cycle of those commodities – from their production through to their disposal. The course will also specifically address the ethical questions and challenges that emerge from these connections and the practical ways in which we might respond to those questions. As in the first semester, the course will involve a combination of lectures, guest speakers, discussion groups, and experiential learning in the city of Halifax. The assignments will include written reflections on specific sites in Halifax which students are expected to visit and explore, a public engagement project, and a series of quizzes (there is no final exam).

CREDIT HOURS: 6
Experiential learning is an opportunity for students to reflect on the global/local and theory/practice dynamics of the world around them. Other programs and departments use terms such as internship, volunteer or co-op placements. IDS has adopted the term experiential learning because it reflects the interplay between academic and practical skills development that this program offers. Experiential learning courses are available for both local/Canadian and international placements. The Canadian component of experiential learning focuses on the themes of community development and public engagement. The international component addresses questions of global citizenship. The Canadian component of experiential learning combines classroom learning with volunteer work experience in a community organization in Halifax or other parts of Canada. Students are required to volunteer for a minimum of 60 hours in each term, or approximately 3 hours/week. In addition to this work, students are required to complete a set of readings (to be developed in collaboration with the course instructor) and three academic assignments (a mid-term report, a reflective paper and an academic paper).

INTD 3118 Experiential Learning: Experiences of Canadian Development: Volunteerism and Citizenship in Times of Austerity I
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Experiential learning is an opportunity for students to reflect on the global/local and theory/practice dynamics of the world around them. Other programs and departments use terms such as internship, volunteer or co-op placements. IDS has adopted the term experiential learning because it reflects the interplay between academic and practical skills development that this program offers. Experiential learning courses are available for both local/Canadian and international placements. The Canadian component of experiential learning focuses on the themes of community development and public engagement. The international component addresses questions of global citizenship. The Canadian component of experiential learning combines classroom learning with volunteer work experience in a community organization in Halifax or other parts of Canada. Students are required to volunteer for a minimum of 60 hours in each term, or approximately 3 hours/week. In addition to this work, students are required to complete a set of readings (to be developed in collaboration with the course instructor) and three academic assignments (a mid-term report, a reflective paper and an academic paper).

INTD 3408 The Cuban Development Model
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course examines the evolution of the Cuban development model, from the Conquest and colonization by the Spanish to the reforms of the early 21st Century. The objective is to develop an understanding of the various development strategies employed by Cuba, particularly since the revolution of 1959. When asked about the Cuban development model, most people nowadays would say "tourism". Thirty years ago it was sugar--as it had been from the beginning of the 16th Century. In fact Cuba obtains most of its hard currency from medical-related services--mainly from the exportation of medical services, but also from the sale of sophisticated biotechnological products. Cuba's approach has evolved dramatically in the last two decades, and particular attention will be paid to thisperiod.

INTD 4322 Children and War
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The aim of this course is to explore the many dynamics of conflict that affect children globally. The course will take both a thematic and case study approach. Currently, conflicts that occur are most often intra-state conflicts. The victims of such conflicts are disproportionately women and children. At the same time, the demographics of many of the most war-torn societies has led to increasing numbers of children being involved in the conflict. This course will aim to explore various aspects related to children and war. On the one hand, the course will discuss the effects of war on children. However, it will also discuss the involvement of children in the participation of war. In addition, what are the responsibilities of the International Community to protect and support children of war? What can we learn from the children that have survived in terms of their agency and resilience? What preventative measures can
 935
 
be taken to better ensure children do not fall victims to armed conflict? The course will also explore aspects of culture and its effects on solutions to the dynamics of children and war. In addition, students will learn about various types of child exploitation that make children vulnerable across the peace and wartime spectrum.

Introduction
Learning to read and speak Italian offers access to an important world culture. While modern Italy began to emerge in its present-day form in the 19th century, the civilizations that preceded it have exerted a strong influence on contemporary culture. Whether in religion, art, music, or science, Italy's past offers many keys to the present. Through its tradition of global exploration and entrepreneurial endeavors, Italy has played a significant role in world history. Today, it is one of the world's wealthiest democratic nations, and a leader in a variety of fields, including film, design, cuisine, and intellectual life. Courses in Italian literature and culture, building on courses in Italian language, will open up to the student this wide and fascinating array of topics.
Degree Programs

Law, Justice and Society
The Law, Justice and Society program brings together the theory and practise of education, working across disciplines to engage thoughtfully and critically with pertinent social and political issues. LJSO offers a multi- and interdisciplinary learning experience for students who are interested in the study of law and justice - be they approached as subjects of historical, philosophical, political, or socio-anthropological enquiry or as an avenue towards career objectives such as work in criminal justice, public policy, legal research, or human rights advocacy. Through theory, research methods, and knowledge from a range of disciplines students will strive to understand the contested nature and uses of law in its various relationships to justice. The opportunity to engage in experiential learning will grow a student's confidence both inside and outside the classroom, along with recognition that learning does not cease once class is over, but is a lifelong process that is both rooted in and directed toward the communities and issues they will learn about in the program.
The LJSO program offers courses on a wide range of topics, from a variety of disciplines including: introduction to law and legal thinking, political ideas and philosophies, human rights, the history of law & justice and crime & punishment, youth crime, the social, moral and legal regulation of sex and gender, and ethics.
The admissions requirements for the Law, Justice and Society Program are listed under the relevant Calendar entry for the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. There are no additional requirements for LJSO beyond those of the Faculty.
Students thinking of majoring or doing an Honours degree in Law, Justice and Society are encouraged to speak with the Program Coordinator about developing a program of studies that suits their needs and interests.

Introduction
Dalhousie provides ways to study many kinds of music, within the vibrant context of our multi-disciplinary Fountain School of Performing Arts. Our offerings range from large survey classes open to students from across the campus, to performing ensembles entered by audition, to one-on-one applied music study for those with demonstrated talent and appropriate prior training. Through our programs, students can develop expertise as listeners, performers, and creators, in styles ranging from classical to popular.
The Bachelor of Music offers focused music studies to prepare graduates for careers or further study in many areas, including performance, composition, theory, musicology, popular music, and more. Through experiential learning, training in music teaches poise, discipline, creativity, collaboration, empathy, and the ability to think on one’s feet. These transferable skills are excellent preparation for many career paths in and beyond the performing arts.
In addition to the BMus, we offer the Honours BA in Music, the BA or BSc Combined Honours and Double Majors with Music, the Minor in Music, the Minor in Musicology, and many elective classes.

Course Descriptions
PERF 1000 Writing About Performance
CREDIT HOURS: 3
What is performance, and who counts as a performer? Why is performance one of the most ancient and durable aspects of human community and interaction? Why do we adore certain performers and despise others? How are performers and their choices shaped by their societies, and vice versa? This course will explore these questions by looking at some of the vital roles fulfilled by theatrical, musical, and cinematic performers in global societies, both ancient and modern. Via readings of articles and plays as well as in-class screenings of film and video performances, it will consider the performer's role in shaping, embodying, and questioning societies' conceptions of beauty, morality, religious faith, gender, race, ethnicity, social class, and more.

MUSC 4360 Advanced Seminar in Baroque Culture
CREDIT HOURS: 6
This course offers its students a survey of key aspects of seventeenth and eighteenth-century European history and society along with a first-hand view of some of the most important aspects of baroque style and material culture. It takes place in the town of Cesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic. The course introduces students to the socio-political conditions that led to the birth of Baroque civilization before entering into an exploration of the court life of seventeenth and eighteenth-century Europe. It then examines the cultural and artistic forms most characteristic of this period, with particular emphasis on opera history and on the role of the ‘theatrical’ in the Baroque arts. As the course proceeds, students will have an opportunity to consider the connections between course material and the evidence of Baroque culture to be found in the Castle Theatre’s scenographic machinery, its stock of original scenery and props, and its collection of historical costumes, as well as to witness an experimental Baroque opera performance. Finally, the course will include visits to Prague and other sites of interest to add to students’ understanding of the Baroque and its legacy to subsequent periods.

 Beginning in Philosophy
There are many different ways of beginning in philosophy. The Dalhousie Philosophy Department offers two sorts of courses for beginners: (1) general survey introductions, which will give you a taste of a variety of questions and answers, and (2) introductions to special areas. Students wishing to major in philosophy are encouraged to begin with Introduction to Philosophy (either PHIL 1500 (part 1) Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy (non-writing), PHIL 1501 (part 2) Epistemology, Metaphysics (non-writing), PHIL 1810 (part 1) Ethics Social and Political Philosophy (writing), PHIL 1820 (part 2) Epistemology, Metaphysics (writing) ). Any student may begin philosophy with a course that has no prerequisites, including most of the courses at the 2000 level. Courses at the 3000 level and beyond usually have prerequisites. See the course descriptions.
We encourage students who plan to pursue a degree in Philosophy to speak with the Undergraduate Advisor.
Degree Programs
All students planning to take a degree in philosophy are encouraged to talk to an undergraduate advisor; those planning to do an honours degree must consult with the honours advisor. Students who intend to specialize in philosophy are encouraged to take an honours degree, which is advantageous for graduate study in philosophy.
In addition to the departmental requirements listed below, students must satisfy the general degree requirements outlined in the Degree Requirements section.
Note: In the statement of program requirements and prerequisites, "credit" means one full credit (six credit hours).
Not all courses are offered every year. Please consult the current timetable to determine if these courses are offered.
Detailed descriptions are available from the department website at philosophy.dal.ca and from the departmental office.

Below you will find descriptions for courses offered in this field of study. You will find a general overview of the topics covered and any prerequisite course or grade requirements, credit value and exclusions.
The first digit of the course indicates the general level. Those in the 1000 series are introductory degree level. Courses at the 2000, 3000, 4000 series are typically available to students in the second, third, and fourth year. Courses numbered at the 5000 level or above are graduate level. Courses listed at the 0100 or 0200 series are technology level courses. Courses below the 0100 level are generally non credit courses.
Some courses are listed as exclusionary to one another. This means that students may not obtain credit for both courses as designated.
Not all courses are offered each year. Please consult the current timetable for this year’s offering. For further information please contact the department, or visit the department's website.
Course Notes
NOTE: Many courses are listed as being exclusionary to one another. This means that students may not take both courses so designated.
NOTE: Courses at the 4000 level are intended for advanced undergraduates with a strong background in philosophy. It is assumed that normally a student will have already taken relevant courses at the 3000-level. Courses with titles beginning "Topics in..." have no description, since the selection of topics and instructor is determined after the time of calendar preparation. These are seminar courses. Interested students should consult the department for up-to-date information.
Course Descriptions
PHIL 1050 Ethics in Science
CREDIT HOURS: 3
An introduction to ethical questions that arise in the practice of science. The course will explore a variety of ethical questions associated with the study and practice of science. Students will learn about the nature of philosophical approaches to ethics and how to employ these insights to the tasks of recognizing and reflecting on ethical issues that arise when engaged in scientific research and practice. One section of this course is offered as part of the Dalhousie Integrated Science Program, that relate to the specific scientific topics studied within that program where it serves as one-half of the writing requirement for first year students and is available to DISP students only.

PHIL 1500 Introduction to Philosophy, Part 1: Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy - Non-Writing Version
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In this class we ask what it is to think logically and critically, whether the existence of God can be proven, whether his existence is relevant to our ethical duties or whether they have some other basis than in divine command (e.g., in contracts for mutual advantage), whether claims about which duties we have can be objectively correct, and whether it is rational to fulfill those duties. We consider sample moral questions, such as whether abortion is permissible, and what duties we have to those less well off, or to animals. Turning to social and political philosophy, we ask what the best political system is, and how goods should be justly distributed. We may ask what racism is, how feminism requires a re-thinking of issues of social justice, whether life has meaning, whether death is to be feared, and whether the value of art works is merely subjective. We learn that the answers to philosophy’s profound questions aren’t just matters of opinion but must pass rigorous standards of justification; and that philosophy engages with our lives. Students will learn how to evaluate the assumptions of their own cultures about these things, to engage in constructive dialogue, and to write and speak

PHIL 1501 Introduction to Philosophy, Part 2: Epistemology, Metaphysics - Non-Writing Class Version
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In this class we review what it is to think logically and critically, then move on to epistemology, which asks what knowledge is and whether it is possible to have knowledge about ourselves, the minds of others, the past, and the future. Might we just be dreaming the physical world, or can we know it exists? What roles do sense perception and scientific method play in knowledge acquisition? How is this complicated by biases caused by, e.g., racism and sexism? We then study such metaphysical issues as whether the existence of the universe proves that God exists, whether a person’s mind is just her brain, whether one can survive bodily death, what it is to be the same person at different times given that everything about a person can be different at a later time, and whether we are really free and morally accountable for the choices we make if, as science says, everything we do is caused by the laws of physics. We learn that the answers to philosophy’s profound questions aren’t just matters of opinion but must pass rigorous standards of justification; and that philosophy engages with our lives. Students will learn how to evaluate the assumptions of their own cultures about these things, to engage in constructive dialogue, and to write and speak clearly and logically.

We learn that the answers to philosophy’s profound questions aren’t just matters of opinion but must pass rigorous standards of justification; and that philosophy engages with our lives. Students will learn how to evaluate the assumptions of their own cultures about these things, to engage in constructive dialogue, and to write and speak clearly and logically. Historical and contemporary readings are studied. This course satisfies one half of the Faculty Writing Requirement, but only if the other half is satisfied by taking: Introduction to Philosophy, Part 2, Writing Class Version. The parts may be taken in any order.

PHIL 1820 Introduction to Philosophy, Part 2: Epistemology, Metaphysics - Writing Class Version
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In this class we review what it is to think logically and critically, then move on to epistemology, which asks what knowledge is and whether it is possible to have knowledge about ourselves, the minds of others, the past, and the future. Might we just be dreaming the physical world, or can we know it exists? What roles do sense perception and scientific method play in knowledge acquisition? How is this complicated by biases caused by, e.g., racism and sexism? We then study such metaphysical issues as whether the existence of the universe proves that God exists, whether a person’s mind is just her brain, whether one can survive bodily death, what it is to be the same person at different times given that everything about a person can be different at a later time, and whether we are really free and morally accountable for the choices we make if, as science says, everything we do is caused by the laws of physics. We learn that the answers to philosophy’s profound questions aren’t just matters of opinion but must pass rigorous standards of justification; and that philosophy engages with our lives. Students will learn how to evaluate the assumptions of their own cultures about these things, to engage in constructive dialogue, and to write and speak clearly and logically.

PHIL 2020 Legal Thinking
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course examines the role of practical reason in resolving legal controversies. It will address various questions on which there is a current legal debate and challenge students to develop their own informed opinions on these matters. Questions may include: Should the state prevent people from ending their lives to escape the pain of terminal disease? Shall we leave people free to makeup their own minds regarding abortion? Should the law be used to control pornography? Is affirmative action demanded by (or inconsistent with) equality under the law? Legislation enacted in these and other controversial areas will dramatically affect how we live. It thus demands our critical attention.

This course examines some of the challenges and pitfalls everyone faces in their attempts to get the knowledge necessary to make better decisions on a wide range of issues. It is a course in applied – ‘street-level’ – epistemology that focuses on how we make (more) informed decisions given that each of us are limited in our knowledge-acquiring capacities, and given that each of us is faced – every day -- with having to rely on information and knowledge sourced from others. By getting clearer on these challenges and pitfalls, we might find that we can know better (in part) by realizing that we are worse at knowing some things than we often suppose.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
Computers can enable people to do things that our present laws and policies were not formulated to cover (hacking, sharing files on the internet, and companies sharing data). In such cases, people need to be able to decide for themselves the best course of action, and defend such decisions. This course aims at developing the ethical reasoning skills and sensitivities that computer professionals will need to make good decisions and to justify them. The course includes a general introduction to ethical theories and their use in making and justifying decisions. We then consider various issues and case studies, illustrating the kinds of problems that can arise from the use and misuse of computers and technology: the responsibilities of computing professionals; ethics on the internet (hacking, computer crime, netiquette); privacy and information; intellectual property; social and political issues (digital divide, computers and work, the internet as a democratic technology).

In what ways are human cognitive systems similar to and different from animal cognitive systems? The course takes a philosophical approach, introducing assumptions and issues arising in research at the intersections of artificial intelligence, robotics, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, animal cognition, evolutionary biology, and philosophy. This is a useful complement to a major in any Cognitive Science discipline, as well as a fascinating investigation of cognition for anyone who has wondered about what the human mind is and how it works.

This course investigates the central ideas of Rationalist philosophers - especially, Descartes, Leibniz and Spinoza. It will provide students with an overview of the central ideas and controversies in this school, such as the proper method of philosophy; the distinction between reason and innate ideas, sense-perception and imagination; the significance of basic ontological categories (substance, mode, cause, force, action); the place of religious belief in philosophy.

PHIL 3445 Philosophy of Mind: The Mind-Body Problem
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course will critically examine philosophical and scientific articles, and possibly short works of fiction, which explore various theories, problems and arguments regarding the status of minds in the physical world and the relationships between mind, body and world. We will explore and discuss controversies regarding the thesis that the mind is (nothing but?) the brain, and issues such as the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence, the problem of subjectivity and consciousness, “naturalized” intentionality (how thoughts—if they are physical things or processes— can have the property of being about other things), and animal cognition.

PHIL 3450 Philosophy of Emotions
CREDIT HOURS: 3
We will concentrate on the resurgence of philosophical interest in the emotions over the last twenty years. Although it is obvious that much human action is emotionally driven, traditionally many philosophers have expressed skepticism about the value of emotions to rational and ethical conduct. Recently, philosophers such as Martha Nussbaum, Amelie Rorty and Ronald De Sousa have argued powerfully that rationality requires emotions. Other philosophers have argued that we need a renewed assessment of the epistemic importance of emotion in revealing power and value. Topics will include emotional rationality; emotion and value; first person authority; cognitive, social constructivist and psycho-evolutionary approaches; emotion and feminist epistemology; emotion, power and racial construction.

PHIL 3476 Liberalism and Global Justice
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This is a course in normative political theory. We will critically examine some recent normative political theory, and then examine the prospects and perils of attempts by recent liberal theory to articulate a principled vision of global justice. We will consider Rawls' original bounded theory of justice and examine some challenges it faces from both cosmopolitan theories of justice and proponents of nationalism. Next we'll consider rival political conceptions of liberal international justice, and Rawls' response in the form of his recent "The Law of Peoples." Concluding, we will examine specific issues of applied political justice (namely, human rights and immigration) as well as issues of economic and social justice and poverty.

Are societies describable by explanatory laws? What counts as an explanation of human behaviour: This course explores these and related questions through a reading of classic and contemporary philosophers and social theorists.

Modern Philosophy is a philosophical perspective in which individuals and their conscious thoughts are paramount. Post-modern philosophy rejects this perspective, replacing it with one in which language and society are paramount. We shall study this perspective in the writings of post-Wittgenstein philosophers like Rorty in the English-speaking world as well as those like Derrida, Irigaray, and Habermas on the Continent. (This course is designed to complement 3640.03 but can be taken independently).

PHIL 3800 Philosophy of Medicine
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Is medicine a science? How should we define health and disease? Do definitions of disease help us to understand cognitive disabilities or disorders? Is a risk for a disease, for instance high cholesterol, itself a disease or is this a misuse of the concept? Should health care professionals provide care whenever a patient claims to be suffering or only when the patient has a recognized disease or disorder? What are the implications of classifying too much of normal human experience as disordered? Are screening tests, for instance mammography, typically a good idea because it is better to be safe than sorry? Should health care providers aim to practice evidence- based medicine? Should complementary and alternative medicine be held to the same epistemic standards as mainstream medicine? In this class, we consider these questions, among others. This course aims to explore perspectives on the most important philosophical issues in the emerging field of philosophy of medicine, with particular attention to medical epistemology and metaphysics.

PHIL 4120 Theory of Rational Decision
CREDIT HOURS: 3
How would rational people choose which actions to do, given what they desire? We will see that theories about this have evolved to respond to such toy problems as the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Deterrence Paradox. We then explore the relationship between rationality and other phenomena, e.g.: is it always rational to be moral? Are persons necessarily rational? (What about those with mental health issues?) Would rational persons always be prudent, i.e., always make choices now in the light of desires they expect to have, not just those they currently have? Are good laws necessarily ones people would find it rational to accept and follow? We eventually examine whether rationality is grounded in people's actual desires, or whether there are objective constraints on desires it is rational to have and to choose from, whether desires are relevant at all, and whether there can be a single standard of rationality for all times and all people. Throughout, we apply philosophical accounts of rationality to selected issues of the moment, e.g., to issues in war, governance, democracy, intelligence, and cyber ethics, many of these dealt with as they arise in processing issues being mooted by the American think tank, the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law. The association between that think tank and the class means that students can expect to have influence at the highest levels of government and policy.

 What is Political Science?
Politics has been described as “Who gets what, when, how, and why” in a society. It is the process by which collective decisions and actions are advocated, debated, contested, and implemented in communities – local, regional, national, and international.
The study of politics, or Political Science, is almost as old as the practice of politics. In ancient civilizations like Greece, political philosophers concerned themselves with the characteristics of a good society, including conceptions of justice and order. These issues still concern political scientists, but their focus now covers a wider range of issues, including institutions of government, non-state actors like social movements or political parties, political identities and divisions, and international relations (including war, peace, trade, aid or humanitarianism).
Political Science is important because it fosters informed citizens in an age of political complexity and uncertainty. It has been described, only partly in jest, as “defence against the dark arts” of politics. The study of Political Science enables students to better understand the exercise of political power and authority, and the values, laws, institutions, and policy processes by which decisions are made and implemented. It also focuses on the similarities and differences between patterns and processes in different political communities, within and beyond our own country. It helps prepare students for a wide range of careers, such as teaching, law, public policy, advocacy, journalism, or business.
The department offers courses on a wide range of topics, including: political ideas and philosophies, political institutions and processes in different parts of the world (e.g., Canada, the US, Africa, Europe, or Latin America), the roles of interest groups and political parties, international politics (including conflict and cooperation, peacebuilding and human rights, and diplomacy and development), and how to do political research (research methods). Course topics also include globalization, environmental politics, aboriginal politics, and the politics of health care, among others.
The admissions requirements for Political Science are listed under the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. There are no additional requirements for Political Science beyond those of the Faculty.
Students thinking of majoring or doing an Honours degree in Political Science are encouraged to speak with the department’s Undergraduate Advisor or Honours Coordinator about developing a program of studies that suits their needs and interests.
For General Interest
Students who have not yet decided on a major, or are looking for an elective in Political Science, should take one of the Introductory courses or consider taking advantage of the DalCAP option.
PLEASE NOTE: Students who complete the King’s Foundation Year program with a grade of "B-" or higher will not be required to complete an Introductory course in Political Science.
Students should take no more than the equivalent of six credit hours in 1000 level Political Science courses.
  1029
 
Degree Programs
Students concentrating in Political Science may take a 90 credit hour minor program, 120 credit hour major, or 120 credit hour honours program. The degree requirements are listed in the University and Faculty regulations, and in departmental regulations outlined below.
A student’s program may consist of a general selection of courses from the Department’s offerings or may emphasize one of the sub-fields of Political Science, as set out below.
Students are encouraged to develop distinctive programs tailored to their own particular interests and circumstances. They should, however, seek advice early in their program to ensure that they are consistent with University regulations.
In addition to the departmental requirements, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Degree Requirements section.
In addition to introductory courses, Political Science courses are divided into four subfields:
• Canadian Government and Politics
• Comparative Government and Politics
• Political Theory and Methodology
• International Politics and Foreign Policy

Honours Program
An Honours program is an alternative version of the undergraduate degree, which involves more intensive—and extensive—coursework within the discipline of Political Science, and requires students to maintain higher grades in relevant courses. It is thus generally seen as a more demanding and prestigious program of study. The Department offers a thesis-based Honours program, which involves independent research chosen by the student, in consultation with their supervisor. Thesis-based honours degrees are designed to teach students how to plan and execute a focused research project, working closely with the supervisor of their choice. Honours students in the Department are given special instruction, both individually and collectively, on methodologies, research design, data collection, ethical issues, and cutting-edge debates in the discipline. They work closely with other Honours students in sharing ideas and experiences as they pursue their respective research projects. The Honours degree is generally chosen by students planning to pursue graduate studies or a professional degree, but it can be a good choice for any student with good preparation, a strong work ethic, and a desire to produce original research. In terms of career development, Honours degrees are useful as they signal that an individual is capable of performing to high standards, can work independently, can think rigorously and creatively, and can express complicated ideas clearly and coherently.
In most cases, students apply to the Honours program at the end of their third year, and, if accepted, are formally enrolled in the program at the start of their fourth year. It is, however, never too early to be thinking about the Honours program, and early attention to program requirements can help ensure successful applications and timely completion. Students considering an Honours degree in Political Science are encouraged to meet with the Honours Coordinator and the Undergraduate Advisor, who will be happy to assist in selecting classes and addressing any administrative questions that may arise.
The deadline each year to apply for the Honours program is August 31st.
Program Requirements
 1035
 
The requirements listed below are just for admission to, and completion of, the Honours program in Political Science. Honours students must also complete the relevant requirements for the College of Arts and Social Sciences (“General Degree Requirements”).
As part of a 120 credit hour degree, the Honours program consists of not less than 54 credit hours, and not more than 60 credit hours, in Political Science above 1000 level. The program requires students to take some specific courses, and to choose some other courses from a list of designated courses, to ensure that they acquire the necessary preparation in “core” areas of Political Science. Exceptions to the requirements stipulated below can only be obtained through written petition to the Undergraduate Committee, which reserves the authority to determine admission into the Honours program in these cases.
Required Courses and Grades
To gain admittance into the Honours program, students must have:
1. B grade average in their last 60 credit hours of coursework;
2. B+ grade average in a group of 24 credit hours in Political Science, which must include:
o
The two core courses for the Political Theory subfield: POLI 2410.03 and POLI 2420.03;
One of the following pairs of 2000-level core courses, representing one of the other subfields of Political Science:
Canadian Politics: POLI 2210.03 and POLI 2220.03; or Comparative Politics: POLI 2301.03 and POLI 2302.03; or International Relations: POLI 2520.03 and POLI 2530.03.
The two research methods courses: POLI 3492.03 and POLI 3493.03;
6 additional credit hours at the 3000- or 4000-level in Political Science.
Students in the Honours program must complete all of the following courses by the end of their program:
• 1000 level: 6 credit hours at the 1000 level in Political Science or the Kings Foundation Year Program (with a final grade of B- or higher) including a writing course
• 2000 level: POLI 2410.03 and POLI 2420.03, plus at least 6 additional credit hours from the 2000-level core courses listed above (i.e., POLI 2210.03 and POLI 2220.03, or POLI 2301.03 and POLI 2302.03, or POLI 2520.03 and POLI 2530.03);
• 3000 level: POLI 3492.03 and POLI 3493.03, plus at least 12 additional credit hours of 3000-level or 4000-level Political Science courses;
• 4000 level: POLI 4601.03 and POLI 4602.03.
• An additional 18 credit hours in Political Science above the 1000 level.
Honours Essay and Honours Seminar
 1036
 
In addition to the courses above, students in the Political Science Honours program will complete an Honours thesis, under the supervision of a faculty member in the department. The Honours thesis is normally undertaken in the fourth year of the program (after admission to the Honours program), and is completed during the academic year.
The Honours thesis is an opportunity for the student to undertake a more sustained scholarly project, featuring theoretical analysis and/or systematic, empirical research. It normally takes the form of a formal essay of approximately 40 double-spaced pages.
Students undertake the Honours thesis with guidance and support from a designated faculty mentor (the Honours thesis supervisor). Students admitted to the Honours program should consult with the Honours Coordinator— usually early in the fall semester—to identify a suitable faculty mentor and make arrangements for supervision. Each student should expect to meet with his or her supervisor regularly in the second half of the Fall and through the Winter term, to report on progress and receive advice on the project. When the Honours thesis is completed (usually in March of the Honours year), the student will sit down with the members of his or her committee—the supervisor, another faculty member (the examiner) and, in most cases, the Honours Coordinator—to answer questions about the Honours project and its results (the oral “defence”).
The Honours thesis is associated with a formal course, led by the Honours Coordinator: the Honours Seminar (POLI 4601.03 and POLI 4602.03), which counts for 6 credit-hours toward the degree. Participation in the Honours Seminar counts toward the "21st grade,” required by the University.
Combined Honours
An Honours program is an alternative version of the undergraduate degree, which involves more intensive—and extensive—coursework within a discipline, and requires students to maintain higher grades in relevant courses. It is thus generally seen as a more demanding and prestigious program of studies.
The Combined Honours is a modified version of the Honours program, which allows students to specialize in more than one discipline. Interested students should also review the procedures and requirements for the regular (“Concentrated”) Honours program, listed separately.
In most cases, students apply to the Combined Honours program at the end of their third year, and, if accepted, are formally enrolled in the program at the start of their fourth year. It is, however, never too early to be thinking about Honours, and early attention to program requirements can help ensure successful applications and timely completion. Students considering an Honours degree in Political Science are encouraged to meet with the Honours Coordinator and the Undergraduate Advisor, who will be happy to assist in selecting classes and addressing any administrative questions that may arise.
The requirements listed below are just for admission to, and completion of, the Combined Honours program in Political Science. Combined Honours students must also complete the relevant requirements for the College of Arts and Social Sciences (“General Degree Requirements”).
The procedures and requirements for Combined Honours depend on which department the student chooses as his or her primary discipline. Those that choose Political Science as the primary discipline for their Combined Honours will apply through the Political Science department, be advised by the Political Science Honours Coordinator, and participate in the Political Science Honours Seminar. Those that choose another department as their primary discipline, will apply through and follow the guidelines for that other department; but they must still satisfy some basic requirements set down by the Political Science department (see below).
For both versions of Combined Honours, the deadline each year to apply is August 31st.
 1037
 
Combined Honours with Political Science as primary discipline
The Department offers a thesis-based Honours program, which involves independent research chosen by students, in consultation with their supervisor. Thesis-based honours degrees are designed to teach students how to design and execute focused research projects, working closely with the supervisor of their choice. Honours students in the Department are given special instruction, both individually and collectively, on methodologies, research design, data collection, ethical issues, and cutting-edge debates in the discipline. They work closely with other Honours students in sharing ideas and experiences as they pursue their respective research projects. The Honours degree is generally chosen by students planning to pursue graduate studies or a professional degree, but they can be a good choice for any student with good preparation, a strong work ethic, and a desire to produce original research. In terms of career development, Honours degrees are useful as they signal that an individual is capable of performing to high standards, can work independently, can think rigorously and creatively, and can express complicated ideas clearly and coherently.
Program Requirements
The requirements listed below are just for admission to, and completion of, the Combined Honours program, with Political Science as primary discipline. Combined Honours students must also complete the relevant requirements for the College of Arts and Social Sciences (“General Degree Requirements”) and for the BA (120 credit hour) Major in Political Science.
The program requires students to take some specific courses, and to choose some other courses from a list of designated courses, to ensure that they acquire the necessary preparation in core areas of Political Science. Exceptions to the requirements stipulated below can only be obtained through written petition to the Undergraduate Committee, which reserves the authority to determine admission into the Honours program in these cases.
To obtain the Combined Honours, the student must also satisfy the specific program requirements required by the other (secondary discipline) department. These are listed separately, in the calendar entry for the other department.
Required Courses and Grades
To gain admittance into the Combined Honours program (with Political Science as the primary discipline), students must have:
1. B grade average in their last 60 credit hours of coursework;
2. B+ grade average in a group of 12 credit hours in Political Science, which must include

Course Descriptions
POLI 1001 Introduction to Government and Politics I
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course, together with POLI 1002, is a general introduction to the study of politics. The two classes together fulfill the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences’ writing requirement. The two courses must be taken in sequence (that is, POLI 1001, followed by POLI 1002), and must be taken in the same academic year. In this introductory course, you will be exposed to the fundamental concepts of political life. It will introduce you to a range of key issues and approaches that animate contemporary politics. Topics addressed will include:
• Fundamental concepts in political science;
• Political philosophies and the bedrocks of various political ideologies;
• The nature and limits of democracy.
The course focuses on the fundamental themes and concepts that help us analyze politics, society, political values, and institutions. It does so through a three dimensional approach: 1. Political Thought: What is ‘politics’? What is ‘political science’? What is the source of Canadian ways of thinking about ‘politics’ and ‘society’? 2. Political Institutions and ‘actors’: What are the rules (both informal and formal) that dictate what is permissible to, and desirable for, these ‘entities’ to do? How do the institutions of the state work? How do they affect us? How did we get to these rules? How does Canada understand and apply them? Do they still matter? 3. Political values and outcomes: What do we want from politics? Why do we want those particular things? Do ‘politics’ and how we think about it matter? Does ‘politics’ affect our everyday life? Does it matter in Canada and in Canadian society? Why (or why not)?
CALENDAR NOTES: This course, together with POLI 1002, is a general introduction to the study of politics. The two classes together fulfill the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences’ writing requirement. The two courses must be taken in sequence (that is, POLI 1001, followed by POLI 1002), and must be taken in the same academic year.

This course, together with POLI 1001, is a general introduction to the study of politics. The two classes together fulfill the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences’ writing requirement. The two courses must be taken in sequence (that is, POLI 1001, followed by POLI 1002), and must be taken in the same academic year. In this introductory course, you will utilize the knowledge gained on the fundamental concepts of political life in POLI 1001, and apply them to gain an understanding of political institutions and political processes, particularly in the Canadian context. In doing so, you will explore a range of key issues and approaches that animate contemporary politics. Topics addressed will include:
• The relationship between citizenship and political power;
• Forms of political participation and electoral systems;
• The relationship between politics and the media.
The course will begin by centering on the basic themes and concepts that help us analyze ‘politics’, society, political values, and institutions, and then moves to apply and understand those concepts as they relate to the Canadian context. It does so through a three

POLI 1065 Political Worlds: the Global Domain
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course, which builds on Political Science 1060, introduces you to key approaches, actors, and issues in the study of global politics. After discussing the role of theory and history in understanding contemporary global politics, it considers the role of national governments, international and regional organizations (like the United Nations, the European Union, or the African Union), Non- governmental organizations (like the Red Cross or Greenpeace), and Multinational Corporations. It then looks at the Politics of Global Security and Human Rights, and the Politics of Global welfare (including trade, poverty alleviation, and environmental stress). The objective is to increase your global political ‘literacy', to better understand contemporary global challenges and to prepare you for further study of international relations and comparative politics.

POLI 2210 Unity and Diversity: The Federal Dynamics of Canadian Politics
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course is an introduction to the social, economic, and participatory dynamics that drive Canadian politics. It covers political culture, regionalism, political economy, interest groups, social movements, and elections. Federalism is central to all these topics, as we study the role of Quebec nationalism in the federation's evolution, the relationship between the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and federalism, the place of emerging “orders of government” (including Aboriginal governments), and debates concerning the causes and consequences of centralization and decentralization in the Canadian federation.

POLI 2220 Political Power and Partisan Politics: The Structures of Canadian Parliamentary Government
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Canadian government is dominated by prime ministers and premiers. Why this concentration of power at both the federal and provincial levels of government? Are Members of Parliament who are not in the Cabinet really “nobodies” as one recent PM characterized them? Are Cabinets themselves becoming no more than “focus groups”? Do unelected partisan aides and public service advisors have more influence than the vast majority of elected representatives? Are political parties irrelevant as vehicles for citizen engagement? Are interest groups or social movements any more relevant? Do elections matter? Are the media merely the political instruments of the business elites? These are among the issues that are examined in this course in an attempt to understand the most critical factors that shape the structuring of power in contemporary Canadian government.

POLI 2230 Municipal Law and City Politics in Canada
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Most Canadians live in cities, yet local government is the weakest unit in our federal system. What accounts for this? After all, local government has often been described as the foundation of democracy. In Canada, local governments have many unique characteristics, from their constitutional status to the council system and a tradition of non-partisan government. We will explore the character of local government and the issues related to local governance, including regional and metropolitan restructuring and citizen participation, municipal finance, provincial-local relations, and the role of the federal government.

POLI 2301 Comparative Politics I: Developed Democracies under Pressure
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The course surveys the methods and scope of Comparative Politics. It does so through an examination of what have been the two major prototypes of democratic systems in the contemporary world: liberal democracies (industrial, capitalist nations) featuring examples of presidential systems (USA) and parliamentary models (UK and Japan); and illiberal democracies as found in some post- communist (Russia) and emerging industrialized states (Mexico). After a general overview of the nature of these classifications, countries from each will be studied in depth. Concepts and theories which are useful for comparing political life in various countries will be discussed. In each case, contemporary trends which put democratic practices under pressure or threaten their continuity altogether will be introduced. It is paired with POLI 2302 on Developing States to provide the core undergraduate requirement in Comparative Politics

POLI 2302 Comparative Politics II: the Developing World
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course proceeds on the assumption that it is fascinating to study diverse political systems and processes in their own right; but further, that through comparison and generalization, we can gain a better understanding of the characteristics of politics everywhere, including our own country. The course surveys the methods and scope of Comparative Politics. It does so through an examination of what have been the three major classifications of political systems in the post-World War II world, with particular focus on "Third World" countries (an increasingly problematic term encompassing "Newly Industrializing Countries" and "Less Developed Countries"). After a general overview of the nature of these classifications, countries from each will be studied in depth. Concepts and theories which are useful for comparing political life in various countries will be discussed.

POLI 2350 Governance and Globalization
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This seminar course provides students with an opportunity for critical evaluation of the reshaping of political processes and institutions that are occurring as the result of globalization. The course will explore the concept of governance in the context of changing dynamics related to the trans-nationalisation of production and increased capital mobility as well as the rise in numbers and influence of NGOs and new social movements. Hence, “new” forms of governance emerging out of decentralization and/or disinvestment of state authority and supra-national arrangements that are broadly captured within the concept of “global governance” will be explored along with traditional concepts of governance that centre on the actors, structures and environments of governmental policy-making. A range of issues will be examined – governance of economies, environment, communications, human rights, health, conflict and complex emergencies – within the context of debates involving the “internationalization” of the state; the role of identities – e.g. nationalist, ethnic, gender, cosmopolitan; the growing relevance of regions and the nature of and prospects for democracy and citizenship.

Why do states fight wars? Commit genocide? Sign treaties? Acquire and sell ballistic missile and nuclear technologies? Join economic and military alliances? Enforce and/or dismantle sanctions against states like Iraq, Iran or North Korea? Why can’t we enforce international law as effectively as we enforce domestic law? Can we identify (and enforce) an objective set of universal moral values to guide relations between states and peoples? Is the U.N. a useful institution or is it destined to fail? Should NATO have intervened in conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda or Afghanistan? What were the factors that led to the US-UK invasion of Iraq in 2003, and what does this tell us about US foreign policy and the origins of major conflict? These are some of the questions the course is designed to answer.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
Foreign Policy is concerned with the way that individual states decide on their priorities and strategies in relation to the rest of the world. This course begins with a brief review of International Relations theories and their application to foreign policy. The main part of the course explores theories about what drives foreign policy decision-making: political systems, bureaucracy, culture, psychology, and leadership. The last part of the course looks at the instruments of foreign policy, with particular attention to the military, trade and investment, and foreign aid. All parts of the course feature a mix of abstract theory and specific, real-world examples.

POLI 2540 Canadian-American Relations
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Canada’s relationship with the United States affects almost every aspect of our political, economic, social and cultural life. The U.S. outranks Canada on all the dimensions of power and influence by factors of 10 or 12 to one, and in some fields (e.g., military capacity) by considerably more. Well over 40% of Canada’s economic production goes into exports, and of that well over 80% goes to the United States. Canadians cannot go to the movies, watch television, listen to popular music, consume fast food, or do errands at the local shopping centre without exposing themselves to what a prominent American political scientist has described as his country’s ‘soft power’. This course will consider how Canadians are affected by these and other influences from south of the border, how they have debated them among themselves, and what public policies have been established in response to the concerns they have generated.

This course will examine the territorial division of political and administrative power and the nature of relations between governments which result from such a division of power, including federal-provincial-municipal or “tri-level” relations. Specific topics will include the role of the courts in constitutional interpretations, the instruments of “fiscal federalism” (including equalization payments, conditional grants, tax sharing arrangements and shared cost programs), administrative relationships and the concept of “executive federalism”. These themes will be pursued further by each student through the preparation of a research paper. This paper will deal with a policy area selected by the student (transportation, education, health, etc.) and will provide an opportunity for a more intensive examination of the impact of intergovernmental relations, on public policy and vice versa.

The purpose of this seminar course, for senior undergraduates, is to provide a thorough and critical understanding of the American national political process and its current crises and contradictions. It will examine the colonial displacement of First Peoples and founding of a colonial “settler” society, the slave-based economy, and the revolutionary route to independence. It examines the framing of the constitution and the novel institutions of separation of powers and federalism. It will consider the contemporary evolution of the presidential-congressional relationship which experiences periods of cooperation, contestation and gridlock, and the important Supreme Court role of judicial review. It will then examine the unique electoral system and political parties and the role of
 1051
 
lobbyists and money in politics. Student will examine persistent divisions of class, race, ethnicity and gender which remain hotly contested in contemporary political discourses and practices. These themes will be set in the context of political economy in the world’s wealthiest, but increasingly unequal, society. Contemporary controversies in governance will be highlighted including the divisive culture of “values” politics. Classes will build around student-lead presentations and debates.

POLI 3420 The International Politics of Mobility
CREDIT HOURS: 3
In 2015 the popular imagination became suddenly aware of the international politics of mobility. Like most popular political issues, many people have strong opinions with a relatively weak understanding of the core issues. This course is designed to give students an in-depth introduction to the history, laws, institutions, and changing political dynamics of international migration. The course places a special emphasis on forced migration, refugee flows, and irregular migration given the unique challenges these trends present for the international system. The overall goal is to help develop the substantive knowledge and analytical tools necessary for understanding the complexities of international mobility in a world of states.

This course will consider the instrumentality of fear and terror in public policy, and its role in fostering public opinion and managing social groups and populations. Drawing on interdisciplinary and theoretical analyses of sex and race discrimination, it will consider various ways in which sexual and racial politics are implicated in the production and proliferation of "terror" in contemporary western societies, in practices perpetrated or sanctioned by both state and non-state actors. It will look at the recent discourses of terrorism and its representation in the media: philosophical considerations of anti-immigrant fear-mongering: and political analyses of the economy of "security" industries. It will also address the role of both state and corporate interest in disaster relief, epidemics, and other social crises.

POLI 3450 Storm and Stress: Romanticism and the Backlash Against Enlightenment Political Thought
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Romanticism is generally seen as a cultural movement, with its expression in literature, music, painting, and philosophy. Yet its effect upon politics have been profound. Nonetheless, there has been little extensive political analysis of the Romantic movement and its effects. This course examines the development of Romanticism, especially in its opposition to rationalism, positivism, and classicism, from the late eighteenth century to the present. It examines the thesis that the early 21st century is experiencing a significant period of neo-romanticism, with its own set of reactions against rationalism and realism. What is the political manifestation of this neoromanticism, and what are the implications for contemporary politics?

POLI 3475 Democratic Theory
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Democracy is an essential component of legitimacy for all western states: few would be inclined to assert their “undemocratic” nature. But what are the essential characteristics of democracy; and to what extent must modern democratic theory remain grounded in nineteenth-century western liberal thought? While this course has a predominantly theoretical orientation, it will include an examination of the relations between democratic theory and economic production/redistribution; as well as an investigation into how democratic theory can be developed in non-Western political contexts.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course is an introduction to empirical research methods in political science and the social sciences more generally. It covers a range of issues that are relevant to both qualitative and quantitative empirical research, but the emphasis is on quantitative strategies (i.e., statistical analysis). Key issues include specification of hypotheses, measurement of variables, case selection, choosing and evaluating research designs, and drawing sound inferences from research findings. The “quantitative” component of the course de- emphasizes statistical theory and math, and focuses instead on the generation and interpretation of statistical results, using statistical software. The course is built around a series of small homework assignments, lab sessions, a formal “data analysis paper,” and a midterm and final exam.

Can people from different cultures understand each other? What is to be a member of a culture? Are societies best thought of as collections of individuals, or are individuals constituted by societies? In what sense are the social sciences "sciences"? Are societies describable by explanatory laws? What counts as an explanation of human behaviour: This course explores these and related questions through a reading of classic and contemporary philosophers and social theorists.

This course examines the formation of international human rights institutions, mechanisms, practices, and related jurisprudence. It provides an overview of the development of international humanitarian law and policy; the treaty system and monitoring bodies; and international criminal court and criminal tribunals. Through analyses of reporting systems under a selection of treaties, we will address how both states and non-government organizations have engaged human rights treaty committees on different conventions and areas of law (e.g., civil and political rights; the rights women, children, migrants, torture victims, etc.), and we will consider their applications within domestic law and policy. We will also look at the formation of international criminal law institutions, and, through a sample of case studies, we will consider their approaches to state and individual responsibility and accountability for persecution, genocide and crimes against humanity.

POLI 3520 Building Democracy and Peace
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Many people have long argued that there is an intimate relationship between democracy and peace. Thus, they claim, democracies are much more inclined to peace - both internal and external than other political systems. It is clear that democracy allows the representation of a large number of interest in a society, and this can lead to peaceful resolution of-or accommodation of -
 1056
 
disputes.There have been many studies about established democracies in this regard, but less research into societies in transition--i.e., countries which are democratizing. Since countries in transition present the majority of countries in the world, it would seem timely to study this phenomenon. Democratization involves a multitude of steps and must therefore incorporate a great variety of actors, particularly in post-conflict societies. The role of three (overlapping) elements in post-conflict societies in the process of democratizing appear to be the key. These elements are civil society, the institutional environment and refugees. This third or fourth year level course will examine these key actors/elements and processes.

POLI 3525 Comparative Foreign Policy Simulation
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course is designed for advanced (i.e., 3rd/4th year) undergraduate and graduate students in Political Science. Once students become familiar with basic concepts, theories and decision-making frameworks developed within the sub-field of comparative foreign policy (part 1), they will be expected to apply what they have learned through participation in an interactive computer simulation involving other university teams throughout North and South America and Eastern and Western Europe. As they attempt to implement policy initiatives and work in teams to resolve international disputes, students will confront foreign policy issues in a context that provides an authenticity of experience. The objective is to enable students to create and test organizational skills, understand the interdependence of international issues, appreciate cultural differences and approaches to world problems, and use computers for multination communications.

This seminar offers a comparative perspective on the political economy of foreign policy in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and South America at the end of the twentieth century. Its focus is how such state and non-state actors in the South relate to the New International Divisions of Labour and Power given the demise of both Bretton Woods and Cold War global regimes. In addition to selective case studies of both large and small states - from Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria to Botswana, Jamaica, Kuwait, and Singapore - it treats formal and informal external relations, from regional intergovernmental institutions to non-governmental coalitions. It also examines new forms of regional conflict and cooperation, including guerrilla struggles and civil societies. It emphasizes the incidence and impact of structural adjustment programs and conditionalities along with the emergence of “new” issues such as debt, democracy, ecology, gender, refugees, and technology. A range of alternative approaches is identified and evaluated appropriate to the contemporary period of revisionism.

POLI 3560 Issues in Global Security and Development
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Security and development are indissolubly linked: development is compromised when security remains problematic, while a secure environment requires some form of sustainable development. Two of the principle manifestations of this ‘security-development nexus’ have been intrastate wars and collapsed states. In 2011 for example, none of the states emerging from civil war had reached any of the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations. Moreover, the security-development relationship conditions our capacity to develop effective policies on how and whether to intervene in 'fragile' or 'collapsed' states where the security environment is highly problematic, and our capacity to contribute to the economic and human development of these countries. This course aims, first, to give students a broad understanding of the various dimensions of the security-development nexus; and second, to address significant practical implications of this nexus. An important portion of the course will examine specific case studies, and feature keynote practitioners who are grappling with these concepts in everyday situations in the field.

In later weeks, some of these theoretical lenses are applied to some specific (recent) foreign policy decisions, including the signing and "unsigning" of the Kyoto Accord, the extension of Permanent Normal Trade Relations status to China, and/or the war in Iraq.

POLI 3587 Internationl Political Economy
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course is composed of two overlapping constituent themes. The first theme is that of competing explanations of international political economic behaviour - behaviour affected by that diffuse political authority characteristic of the international system, the second, that of examining the basic issues in international political economy - the fundamental questions as to why international trade, international finance, unequal economic development, international organization, and the multinational enterprise. The first theme functions to create the over-all framework of analysis by which competing approaches to international political economy can be evaluated. The second theme will integrate these approaches with issue areas within the fields of international trade, international finance, and what might be termed "international production" (within which fields issues such as economic development, the multinational enterprise, and the global "division of labour" constitute the major foci). The course sessions will roughly be constituted by 50 percent lecture and 50 percent organized student contributions for seminar discussion and debate.

POLI 3596 Exploring Conflict and Violence
CREDIT HOURS: 3
As the Cold War ended, many people believed that we would see an unprecedented era of peace. And yet large-scale violence associated with war and conflict continues to have undeniable relevance for all of humanity. Given the (apparent) increase of ethnic and religious conflicts and spread of advanced weapons technology world wide, providing answers to pressing questions about the onset and escalation of war is becoming more and more imperative. How do we define war and conflict? Are there rules about conduct in war? What are the causes of conflict? Is warfare becoming more common or is it decreasing? What international institutions exist to prevent or intervene in conflict? How has technology changed warfare? Unfortunately, notwithstanding many years of inquiry into the nature and origins of war, many questions remain to be answered. This seminar is designed to provide students with a comprehensive and critical review of the onset, escalation and de-escalation of violent conflict.

POLI 4221 Canadian Parties in Comparative Perspective
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This is an advanced undergraduate/graduate course that explores the organization, role, functions, and decline (?) of political parties in modern democracies. Although we will spend considerable time exploring the Canadian case, debates surrounding Canadian parties will be situated in a broader comparative context. In doing so we will consider the extent to which Canadian parties are ‘unique’. Throughout the course we will consider whether and how the institutional features of the Canadian state (e.g., federalism) and the makeup of Canadian society (e.g., regionalism, multinationalism, etc.) effect the organization, character, and functions of our parties. The topics to be covered include party organization, party membership, personnel recruitment, and election campaigning. While in no way a prerequisite, students may find it beneficial to take POLI 3224 prior to this class as it provides an introduction to Canadian parties.

POLI 4234 Canadian Urban Politics in Comparative Perspective
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course examines the politics and governance of Canadian cities from a comparative perspective. More specifically, the course uses comparative method in three ways: it asks what one can learn from comparing Canadian cities with each other (subnational comparisons), what cross-national comparisons of Canadian cities can teach as well as compares Canadian cities implicitly with other cities by applying theories of urban politics and development that have been developed elsewhere to Canadian cities. The objective of this course is to provide advanced political science students with the theoretical, empirical and methodological tools to understand and explain the political development of Canadian cities.

POLI 4240 Policy Formulation in Canada
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course provides a general introduction to the field of policy management, for graduate and honours undergraduate students. Using British ‘best practice’ ideas of professional policy making and Canadian statements of generic policy competencies, it seeks to improve the policy capacity of participants. It does this first by increasing their knowledge of public policy structures, processes, and outputs, and secondly, by giving them knowledge that they can use in policy advocacy both inside and outside government. The first section of the course examines policy definitions and professional policy making approaches in the 21st century. The second section considers the role of the state in the 21st century, and the policy competencies that analysts must have if that role is to be carried out effectively. Section three explores vertical, horizontal and external policy relationships, both as determinants of policy and as practical matters of management. Section four explores, and helps participants to gain proficiency in, the most recent processes of strategic policy design and implementation. This blend of theory and practice will increase the policy knowledge of all participants, and equip those who are in professional programs, including the various public services, to contribute more effectively to policy processes in the future.SIGNATURE REQUIRED.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
Political behavior is the study of the private roots of public action. To understand how and why people act politically, we delve into psychology, family life, sexuality, and genetics. In addition to these individual characteristics, the economy, geography, and class drive the political behaviour of individuals and organized groups. Topics include: public opinion, political polarization, culture wars, elections, modernization theory, populism, democratization, and the resource curse. The final unit considers big data and commercial applications of social science research in political practice. Although this material is comparative, we principally want to investigate how it applies to Canada.

The aim is to enable the student to analyze and understand the international roles played by the EU in both economic and political areas. Why has the EU been better able to speak with one voice in economic areas than political areas? To what extent can the member states control the foreign policies of the EU? The introductory part will include an overview of the EU governance systems in the area of external economic relations (first pillar) and the Common Foreign and Security Policy (the second pillar) and analyses of the main achievements in both areas. Specific topics to be selected for analyses during the second part will include the EU and the WTO, the EU and the US, the EU and the East Asia, and the EU and developing countries. Finally, in the third part of the course students study recent efforts to develop a European Security and Defence Policy.

POLI 4450 Political Theories of International Ethics and Global Justice
CREDIT HOURS: 3
What duties do states, and their members, have beyond their borders? Are obligations of justice global in scope? Or, alternatively, are they constrained by national borders? What is the moral standing of states? This advanced undergraduate-level seminar course will focus on contemporary debates in international political theory. In this course we will discuss liberal, republican and discursive democratic perspectives on issues of global justice, particularly in light of global social structures and international inequalities. Major themes include: the historical roots of international relations theory; global distributive justice; republicanism and the ideal of non- domination; the possibility of global discursive democracy; cosmopolitanism; the moral relevance of borders; nationalism, patriotism and special duties; sovereignty, international law and the international order. Major thinkers include: Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, Jürgen Habermas, Phillip Pettit, Charles Beitz, Thomas Pogge, Iris Marion Young and Seyla Benhabib, among others. Students should therefore have a background in political theory. The course will consist of seminar discussions, framed by short presentations by students that draw on their critical reflection papers.

POLI 4466 The Social and Political Construction of Health and Medicine
 1068
 
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Despite the rise of “evidence-based medicine,” the way in which health and illness are understood and addressed remains strongly influenced by social and political variables. This class examines the way in which the “scientific” evidence underlying medicine is constructed and applied; the manner in which certain categories of illness (depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction, low libido, and obesity) are mediated by social and political dynamics; and the role of specific social and political agents in shaping how health and illness are conceived and addressed. In contradistinction to POLI 4260, which focuses on systems and institutions, this class looks at the way in which ideas and epistemology shape conceptions of health, the design of health policy, and the practice of medicine.

POLI 4561 Security-Development Nexus: Theory, Policy and Complex Operations
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Security and development are indissolubly linked: development is compromised when security remains problematic, while a secure environment requires some form of sustainable development. Two of the principle manifestations of this ‘security-development nexus’ have been intrastate wars and collapsed states. In 2011 for example, none of the states emerging from civil war had reached any of the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations. Moreover, the security-development relationship conditions our capacity to develop effective policies on how and whether to intervene in 'fragile' or 'collapsed' states where the security environment is highly problematic, and our capacity to contribute to the economic and human development of these countries. This course aims, first, to give students a broad understanding of the various dimensions of the security-development nexus; and second, to address significant practical implications of this nexus. An important portion of the course will examine specific case studies, and feature an interagency simulation to provide students with a sense of what it is like to grapple these concepts beyond the classroom.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This advanced seminar course is concerned with the 'structure-agent' problem as it applies to Canadian foreign policy. In other words, what are the structures (both material and normative) that shape and constrain the pursuit of Canadian foreign policy; what room for maneuver and initiative is there; and who are the key actors, or the 'agents' who shape and implement Canada's global role? The course discusses these questions through four sections: theoretical and analytical approaches to the study of Canadian foreign policy; the external context; the domestic; and key themes and issues in Canadian foreign policy.

POLI 4587 International Political Economy
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course is composed of two overlapping constituent themes. The first theme is that of competing explanations of international political economic behaviour - behaviour affected by that diffuse political authority characteristic of the international system, the second, that of examining the basic issues in international political economy - the fundamental questions as to why international trade, international finance, unequal economic development, international organization, and the multinational enterprise. The first theme functions to create the over-all framework of analysis by which competing approaches to international political economy can be evaluated. The second theme will integrate these approaches with issue areas within the fields of international trade, international finance, and what might be termed "international production" (within which fields issues such as economic development, the multinational enterprise, and the global "division of labour" constitute the major foci). The course sessions will roughly be constituted by 50 percent lecture and 50 percent organized student contributions for seminar discussion and debate.

Introduction
Religion is a phenomenon virtually universal in human society and history. Understanding religion involves grasping simultaneously both the meaning of faith in the lives of participants, and the critical analysis of outside observers. Both the student wishing enhanced understanding of religion as an historical, and social and human fact, and the student who wishes to wrestle with problems arising in academic reflection concerning the relation between the personal and the objective, can find material to engage them in the programs and courses described below.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
The 'scientific revolution' is ordinarily construed as the triumph of reason over superstition, of science over sorcery. This course argues that the rhetoric of 'enlightenment' conceals a deep continuity between Modern science and the occult traditions of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The prototype of the experimental scientist is the Faustian magus. We investigate the role of Hermeticism, magic and the occult in the scientific revolution and the persistence of these esoteric currents in later movements, from German Naturphilosophie to Jungian psychology.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course traces the development of Christianity from its origin as a Jewish sect to its status as the dominant religion within the Byzantine Empire. The Christian religion as patronized by the Eastern Roman Emperors identified itself with the persecuted Christian sect of the first three centuries through the cult of the martyrs, articulated in the increasing importance of relic, icon, and pilgrimage to holy place. The seven ecumenical councils (325-787) progressively defined the Orthodox faith and resulted in the rise of Oriental churches, rejecting aspects of the definitions. Through to our end-date of 843 (when the icon was finally accepted) themes will be treated by attention to historical events (including the rise of Islam), art, architecture, liturgy, and various genres of literature (including hagiography).

The period of European history from 1500 to 1800 saw the rise of modern science and philosophy. It was also a period in which thousands of witch trials and executions were carried out. This course will seek to understand how these seemingly contradictory developments could have occurred simultaneously. The course will examine changing conceptions of the witch and witchcraft in their historical, intellectual, cultural, religious, and political contexts. Questions that will be addressed include: How did the Renaissance interest in magic influence the Early Modern understanding of witchcraft? What impact did concerns about popular religion have on the witch trials? What constituted evidence that someone was a witch? What did Early Modern scientists think about witchcraft? The

Beginning with an overview of the history and methodology of the study of science and religion, encounters between science and religion are traced from the dawn of civilization to the end of the eighteenth century, with a special focus on the early modern period. From an examination of the biblical view of nature, ancient Babylonian astrology and divination and Plato's Timaeus, this course moves through a treatment of the centrality of theology to Medieval science on to natural theology and the “Watchmaker” Design Argument of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Models of conflict, harmony and complementarity offered to characterize relations between science and religion are explored through case studies such as Galileo’s controversy with the Church and instances where religious belief inspired scientists like Boyle and Newton. Claims that certain confessional traditions (notably Protestantism and its dissenting offshoots) facilitated the rise of modern science are also appraised. Science-religion relations are examined both from the standpoint of mainstream religion and with respect to religious heterodoxy, prophecy, alchemy, magic and witchcraft. This course employs examples from Islamic cultures in addition to the Judeo-Christian tradition. Special features include a focus on primary texts and guest lectures by scientists.

RELS 3510 Sultans and Shahs: Polity and Religion in the Islamic Gunpowder Age (1500-1800)
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Until the devastating Mongol invasions of the 13th century, the principal centers of Islamic power, culture, and thought had been based in Cairo and Baghdad. This course will examine the post-Mongol Islamic world, and how politics and religion were irrevocably changed with the annihilation of the Sunni `Abbasid caliphate. Religious heterodoxy, combined with the power vacuum left by Chingiz Khan and his descendents, allowed for the emergence of a number of unique Turkmen states in Western Asia, the most famous being the Ottoman Turks of Anatolia. By 1500, innovations in military technology and the paper-making industry allowed for the emergence of centralized and bureaucratically-sophisticated 'gunpowder' empires in western and south Asia. This course will discuss the three most significant of these: the Ottoman Turks (based in Istanbul), the Safavid Persians (based in Isfahan), and the Mughal Indians (based in Delhi). Areas of focus will include: issues of political legitimacy, use of military 'slave' corps, orthodox and popular religious movements, tensions between nomadic and sedentary segments of society, innovations in cultural expression (poetry, art, architecture), scientific and philosophical development, and the penetration and impact of the Portuguese, English, Dutch, and French 'world economies' into Asia and the Indian Ocean. This course will also examine different debates regarding the 'decline of the East', and introduce the theoretical implications of how the Islamic world is approached by contemporary scholarship.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course provides a transition from first-year Sanskrit grammar to the reading of simple Sanskrit texts in their original form. In the first weeks, the materials selected for reading will be examined slowly and thoroughly as a means of introducing key aspects of grammar not covered in in the first year (notably the infinitive, simple future, additional forms of compounds, present participial adjective, optative, gerundive, absolute constructions, causative and reduplicating perfect). Students thus will be equipped with the tools for independent reading of simple narrative and epic sources such as the Pañcatantra, Hitopadesa, Kathasaritsagara, Mahabharata, Hariva?sa, and Ramaya?a.

 Introduction
The Russian Studies Department offers courses in Russian language, literature, culture and history. Since Russia plays a crucial role in today’s world and makes important contributions in a wide variety of scientific, technical, and humanistic fields, knowledge of its linguistic and cultural backgrounds can prove advantageous in many areas of study. Recent radical shifts in the country have significantly widened opportunities for using Russian in business, law, science, and government.
In the language courses emphasis is placed on gaining a thorough grasp of Russian grammar combined with practical competence in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Sections are small and intensive. Classroom work is supplemented by computerized audio-visual materials. Study of Russian literature begins with a general survey intended for first or second year students, followed by monograph, period, and genre courses. Literature courses are generally offered in both English and Russian in order to give as many students as possible from other disciplines the opportunity to become acquainted with this important part of Russian life.
Courses in Russian culture and civilization are intended to introduce students to art, architecture, music, religion, and other areas of Russian life which are necessary to understand the language and literature. Films, guest speakers, and evenings of Russian poetry are scheduled periodically. The Dalhousie Association of Russian Students organizes a variety of events throughout the year.
 1102
 
Major or honours students may, with the approval of the Russian Studies Department, take up to one semester (15 credit hours) of work at a university in Russia and receive credit at Dalhousie. Qualified students are urged to participate in the Intensive Russian Program, founded by Dalhousie, which enables Canadian students to study for a semester at St. Petersburg State University.
Degree Programs
Courses in the Russian Studies Department are open to students either (1) as electives in any degree program; (2) as constituents of a major or honours degree in Russian; or (3) with courses in another discipline forming part of a combined honours degree or double major; or (4) as a minor.
All Bachelor degree programs are governed by the general Requirements for Degrees set out in the University Calendar, in addition to the departmental requirements stated below. See Degree Requirements section.

RUSN 3102 Black Identity in Pushkin (Russian)
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Conducted in Russian. A close study of the poetry and prose of the father of Russian literature, Aleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin, needs to be grounded in the centrality of his Black Identity for his life and oeuvre. Pushkin's unfinished work Arap Petra Velikogo serves as the window illuminating his artistic genius and struggle for a mode of expression for his own identity. The silences which shroud Pushkin's blackness are probed to reveal their ideological, historical, legal and human significance, which are then critically assessed. The major narrative and lyric poems, Eugene Onegin, the Little Tragedies, Boris Godunov, the Tales of Belkin, the Queen of Spades, as well as Pushkin's letters and critical works are revisited in this new light. Students will explore such themes as marginalization, liberty, prescience, aesthetic innovation, and the poet as political symbol and creator of a new literary language. Restoring Pushkin's identity to its proper place is a condition -- sine qua non-- for understanding the true meaning of his work for modern literature and its ongoing influence on world culture.

Introduction
Social Anthropology and Sociology are related and overlapping disciplines. Although in some universities they are found in separate departments, this Department and many of its courses blur the distinction between them and emphasize the areas of overlap. The Department is committed to a program which stresses the areas of convergence between the two disciplines.
Sociology and Social Anthropology provide an academic training which is rigorous and cosmopolitan. Students develop research skills along with a general intellectual preparation which stands them in good stead for graduate work in the disciplines or for a broad range of professions such as law, medicine, social work or journalism.
Sociology
From its inception in the nineteenth century, sociology has been concerned with understanding the growth and evolution of modern societies. Classical sociologists attempted to identify universal laws of human behaviour which would help them to understand the nature of social change and of social order, the role of the individual vis- a-vis the broader society, and the production and reproduction of social inequalities. While contemporary sociologists have abandoned the search foruniversal laws, the discipline continues to study the social context of human action, and has contributed substantially to knowledge and understanding of our own world.
Social Anthropology
Anthropology is composed of four subfields, social/cultural, archaeological, biological, and linguistic. The strength of our program is the minor upon Social Anthropology, the area most complementary to Sociology. Social
 1125
 
Anthropology, with its emphases on global context, continuity and change, questions of human and group identity, and views on human nature, may focus on local cultures or entire civilizations. For example, some Social Anthropologists study historical and contemporary conditions of indigenous groups, tribal or peasant societies, others conduct their research within industrial societies. Our program provides the opportunity for students to become conversant with the comparative cultural implications of modern societies such as different forms of family and kinship practices, changing gender relations, the organization of work, law and social injustice, medicine and health, religion, and political economy. How do people in different places and times react, resist, and adapt to change?
Degree Programs
The Department’s BA degree program is offered as a 90 credit hour minor or a 120 credit hour major in Sociology and Social Anthropology. The BA honours degree is offered through more specialized programs of study in Sociology or in Social Anthropology. Dalhousie graduates wishing to upgrade from a 90 credit hour minor may complete an additional 30 credit hours to be awarded the Major Conversion or the Honours Conversion. An honours degree is normally the required preparation for graduate study.
All Bachelors degree programs are governed by the general Requirements for Degrees set out in the University Calendar, in addition to the departmental requirements stated below. See Degree Requirements for complete details.
NOTE:
1. No more than six credit hours may be obtained for introductory courses from SOSA 1000.06, SOSA 1050.06, SOSA 1100.06, SOSA 1200.06, SOSA 1500.06, SOSA 1002.03, SOSA 1003.03.
2. For purposes of gaining entry to 2000 and 3000 level SOSA courses, King’s Foundation Year satisfies the introductory course prerequisite.
3. If they so elect, King’s Foundation Year students may also obtain credit for one introductory course from SOSA 1000.06, SOSA 1050.06, SOSA 1100.06, or SOSA 1200.06, SOSA 1500.06 or both SOSA 1002.03 and SOSA 1003.03.

Concentrated Honours BA Program
The Department’s honours programs are designed for students with an interest in, and demonstrated aptitude for, advanced study in either Sociology or Social Anthropology. Admission to these programs is based solely on academic performance. More specifically, the Department requires a grade average of B+ (3.30) or higher on courses above 1000 in SOSA and the minor (or second major) subject. In addition, a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.70 is required. Potential applicants should consult with one of the Department’s Undergraduate Advisors, preferably during their second year of study, and should plan to take the 3000 level courses required for honours during their third year. The Advisor will assist the student to design a program of study with a minor in Social Anthropology or Sociology meeting the general Faculty requirements and the specific requirements for each
 1127
 
program as set out below. It is important that students have a strong foundation before undertaking the honours thesis, therefore the sociology 2000 bundle (SOSA 2007 Thinking Sociologically along with SOSA 2008 Doing Sociology) or the social anthropology 2000 bundle (SOSA 2012 Thinking through Anthropology along with SOSA 2013 Anthropology in Practice), and two of the required 3000 level courses are pre-requisites to the departmental Honours Seminar (SOSA 4000 X/Y or SOSA 4500 X/Y).
This fulfills the College of Arts andScience Honours Qualifying Examination requirement. Students with the honours concentration in Sociology may not declare Social Anthropology as their secondary subject; students with the honours concentration Social Anthropology may not declare Sociology as their secondary subject.

Course Descriptions
SOSA 1002 People and Culture: Introduction to Social Anthropology
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course is an introduction to Social Anthropology. Social anthropologists study cultural diversity in western and non-western societies. Often living among the people they study, anthropologists attempt to understand the structures that shape and constrain peoples’ lives, and the ways in which people make sense of their changing circumstances. Classic studies focused on rural people in the developing world (hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, peasants). Contemporary studies are just as likely to focus on development, migration, artists, boardroom rituals or street gangs. Theories and methods from anthropology can be applied to a wide range of academic and practical settings including development, politics, economics, health, law, art, and human rights.

CREDIT HOURS: 6
Sociologists are interested in understanding the social world. They do not rely on preconceived ideas alone to enrich this understanding, but see the need to conduct studies, carry out investigations, make observations, analyze findings, formulate ideas, and construct theories and interpretations about what they find. This course looks at the ways sociologists go about their work. What are some of the dominant ways of thinking current in sociology today? What are the relationships between such ways of thinking and what are seen as questions to investigate? How do sociologists do their research? What are social surveys, interviews, theories, sociological ideas? What is distinctive about a sociological way of looking at a problem?

SOSA 2006 Global Migration: Transnational Lives
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Some observers propose that we are living in an “age of migration” because there are now more international migrants than ever before. Millions of people also migrate within their own countries from rural to urban areas in search of employment and other opportunities that cities are perceived to offer. Migration as a social phenomenon is inextricably linked to important global concerns such as wealth disparities both between countries and within countries between social classes, as certain groups of people are displaced or dispossessed from land-based livelihoods. Global migration also involves major gender and ethnic inequalities, human rights issues, and produces differential access to citizenship.

SOSA 2140 Going Global; Geography, Economy, and Work in the 21st Century
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course will explore the economic, industrial and organizational transformations which have affected world economies since the 1980s. The spatial reorganization of the international division of labour has led to "world cities", and rural concentration and depopulation, as well as exploitative economic enclaves as endpoints in global commodity chains. The emergence of an increasingly integrated international economic order are associated, in the advanced economies, with a shift from manufacturing, for which automobile production has been the standard example, to a service-dominated economy, ranging from financial services, internet development and movie and music creation, to fast food chains and mass tourism. This industrial transformation has been accompanied by shifts in organizational structures, whether the emphasis has been on increased operational flexibility, or downsizing, one is continuously faced with the impact of new information technologies on the workplace. Does the electronic storage and transmission of information create acceptable efficiencies, or do they represent new methods for controlling and exploiting an increasingly vulnerable workforce, particularly lower-class women and/or immigrants? This course will employ the relevant portions of a standard Canadian sociological text to evaluate main tendencies, while selected anthropological case studies from different places will help understand the specific dynamics of a new, world economy.

SOSA 2141 Why Work?
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Work, as the journalist Studs Terkel once wrote, is a source of “daily meaning as well as daily bread.” It comes in many forms. There are careers, “callings,” or just-for-now jobs, which can be paid or unpaid, permanent or temporary, prestigious or menial, dangerous or boring. For some of us, work is an opportunity to “Do What You Love”; for others, the best part of work is the pay cheque. How we go about making a living is in some ways a personal choice, but it's also a social and political matter. In this course, students will learn how we make sense of work in all its forms. Topics covered may include: internships and precarious work, (de)industrialization, unions, generations and work, gender and work, labour market trends, professions, leisure, and the future of work.

SOSA 2181 Explaining Crime and Criminal Behavior
CREDIT HOURS: 3
What is crime, why do rates of crime vary, why do people commit crimes and how do social, cultural, psychological and biological theories and research findings explain crime as social and behavioral phenomena? Criminology is an interdisciplinary attempt to answer these questions through the social scientific study and analysis of crime and criminal behavior. This course introduces students to a broad variety of critical thinking, disciplinary theories, research studies and social policies, in order to help you understand and explain crime and show how these understandings inform the policies and politics designed to manage and prevent crime. This course provides a general but primarily sociological understanding of crime.

This course introduces students to the sociological study of gender and sexuality. It explores how socio-economic and cultural conditions— particularly in contemporary Canada— shape our understandings and experiences of gender and sexuality and how both intersect with age, ethnicity, class and other markers of identity. Specific topics to be examined may include the interconnected histories of sexuality and gender expectations in western societies, representations of gender and sexuality in the contemporary media, the family as a changing social institution and/or the social organization of intimate relationships, and different forms of gender and sexual activism and the notions of justice that they represent. Students taking this course will gain an in-depth understanding of gender and sexuality as evolving socially constructed concepts that have real and multiple effects.

You may not think of yourself as political, but power is a process of everyday life. Although it is often assumed to be located in economic and political institutions, it is also important to consider that “the personal is political” and this too contributes to the negotiation of power. This course will explore how social processes affect and are shaped by material, institutional, and normative pressures. Contemporary examples of the intersection of these social forces will show how sociology and social anthropology can be used to identify otherwise hidden relationships.

SOSA 3005 Knowledge, Work and Culture in the Contemporary World
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Since the publication of Daniel Bell's book, The Coming of Postindustrial Society, studies of the economic structure of the advanced societies have addressed the question of the extent to which we are living through a transition to a new, knowledge-driven economy which may be qualitatively distinguished from the system of industrial capitalism which has characterized North America and western Europe for most of this century. Whether one uses terms like “postindustrialism”, “postmaterialism” or “postmodernism”, debates have centered on the question of fundamental alterations in the economic, cultural and political organization of technologically advanced societies. Are we witnessing the creation of an “information economy”, are we observing the emergence of a new “knowledge class”, which rules by virtue of its educational skills and credentials, is there a new underclass being excluded from paid employment of any form, and is government being privatized to facilitate new forms of global economic integration? Are new types of social movements arising in response to basic changes in our society? This course will address the above questions, with particular emphasis being devoted to discuss issues in contemporary political economy.

Does culture permeate all aspects of social life or are there specialized social domains which are “cultural”? What is the connection between societies and “cultures” and the “culture” of music or art? This course explores the question of how one can sociologically study culture. The course reviews classical and contemporary theoretical approaches to the social production, distribution and reception of culture. Broad themes include the discussion of cultural consumption, cultural identity, cultural change, and notions of cultural resistance. Specific “cultural objects” of study may include fashion, sport, class, and social problems. The course concludes with analysis of the intersection of the fields of sociology and cultural studies.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
Placing the political economic bases of health and illness in ethnographic context, this course is concerned with the ways that
 1152
 
afflictions of poverty become naturalized as biomedical experiences. Core questions pursed are as follows: 1) how is relative health affected by the world market pressures in diverse global contexts? 2) how do afflictions of poverty become naturalized as biomedical experiences: 3) how do patients and communities activate alternative health infrastructures as they resist their marginalization in neo- liberal political agendas? 4) what kinds of illnesses are characteristic of capitalism and wage labour migration (e.g. HIV/AIDS; SARS)? 5) how have market pressures and profit seeking retarded the progress of scientific inquiry into modern illness? We will elucidate these questions by looking at case studies from Canada, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Spain and Brazil.

SOSA 3145 Gender and Health
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course aims to reflect upon and challenge our taken-for-granted assumptions about the gendered dimensions of health and healthcare. Rather than take the categories of 'women's health' and 'men's health' as its foundation, the course revolves around two main questions: (1) how does the field of health and healthcare define and enforce the very categories of 'women' and 'men'?; (2) how does gender, thus defined and enforced, affect the health, healthcare, and health work of those defined as men, women, or other? We will consider these questions by examining particular health topics that have a strongly gendered component, such as sexual health, reproductive health, and disability. Throughout the course, we will explore the theoretical perspectives used in the field; the two-sex model and challenges to it; the gendering of particular health problems and health professions; the medicalization of womanhood and, more recently, manhood; and the relationships between gender and other forms of social classification (e.g. race, class, sexual orientation). It is recommended that students take SOSA 2501 or SOSA 2400 or SOSA 2503 prior to taking this course.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course explores childhood as an important reflection of socialization and thus a nexus of cultural and social values, ideas, and histories. In examining pregnancy, birth, infant development and socialization patterns, we ask: What is universal, what is near universal, and what is indisputably variable? The course tries to maintain a balance among three perspectives: those of the infant; those of the parents; and relevant cultural and historical factors that shape both of these. The course also seeks to maintain a balance between the biological, cultural and social nature of human behavior. Approved with International Development Studies.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
The general topic of unstructured group activity encompasses phenomena traditionally classified as collective behaviour incidents, as well as reformist and revolutionary social movements. Although there is considerable overlap, the collective behaviour literature tends to focus on relatively brief and spontaneous activities, such as panics, disasters, and crazes, while work on social movements examines relatively more organized and enduring group activities which still fall outside the realm of normal institutions. This course investigates problems emerging from both areas of concern. Emphasis is given to relevant Canadian materials.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
The majority of the world's population, even today, lives in rural settings and depends upon primary production as the principal source of livelihood. This does not mean, however, that rural life has remained static and unchanging over the centuries. All rural societies, even those remote from centres of world power, have long been caught up in the world economic system and involved, in particular ways, with capitalist relations of production. This course examines continuity and change in a range of rural contexts across several continents including North America, and encourages students to consider the notion of “development” from alternative perspectives.

SOSA 3215 Migration and Identity
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course explores the inter-relating of migration and identity under conditions that are now described as globalization. Migrants become immigrants in particular places. Most depart as citizens of one country seeking temporary refuge, employment, or new citizenship at their destination. As they travel, migrants negotiate the multiple (sometimes competing) demands of kin, employers, and policies set by more than one state. Because commitments and obligations they experience straddle the borders they have crossed, migrants lives are transnational. their ideas of “home” and identity are also reworked as they travel and can be conflicted as their circumstances change. Some writers have concluded contemporary migration is both turbulent and chaotic compared with historical examples. This course begins with review of some historical migration examples and critically reviews how these differ from current globalization flows. However, the main focus is on particular instances of migration as described in ethnographic and sociological case studies. Some key concepts to be discusses in the course are diaspora, transnationalism, and ethnoscape. Approved with International Development Studies.

SOSA 3260 Deviance and Society: Making Norms, Regulating Difference
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course examines how social norms are enforced—and what happens when they are broken. So many aspects of our lives are regulated by and measured against socially defined norms and standards, from our weight and sexual behavior, to how we dress and which substances we consume. But social norms get violated, too, and such ‘deviance’ has long been a preoccupation of sociologists and social anthropologists. What and who counts as deviant and how deviance is managed vary dramatically across historical periods, cultures, and regimes of social control. By applying social theories of deviance and normalization to case studies in health, law/crime, and morality, this course encourages students to think more critically about how and why our society responds to difference. In the first half of the course, we will focus on the concept of norms and on sociological approaches to theorizing deviance from social norms. In the second half of the course, our focus shifts to experiences and techniques of social control--the management of deviants and deviance.

Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the relationship between global processes and the issues of crime and terrorism have become more explicit. As new or enhanced global economic, political, cultural and environmental processes facilitate profound social and cultural change, new pressures and opportunities for both traditional and new kinds of crime and various forms of political and religious violence are being created. This course examines how globalization influences the various global and local conditions that create these new kinds crime and terrorism by exploring various theoretical explanations, and more empirically based case studies of different global crimes and terrorism movements. In addition we will explore how global organized crime and terrorism challenges the ability of western societies and states to ensure political order and security and examine how they are reconfiguring both the rhetoric and reality of state governance and justice.

SOSA 3401 History of Sociological Thought
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Towards the middle of the nineteenth century a novel way of thinking about human existence began to emerge. Primacy was given to the understanding that humans are social beings, their lives and thoughts bounded and patterned by their social environments. This approach formed the basis for a new discipline of analysis eventually named Sociology. This course considers some of the main ideas of the earlier contributors to the new way of thinking: Comte, Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Simmel, Mead, Mannheim and, more recently, Parsons and Schutz. Modern sociology rests largely on the intellectual legacy of these thinkers. They raise questions and formulate answers to them which remain relevant to the sociological enterprise today.

 Introduction
Spanish is the most widely spoken language in the world after Chinese and English. In 2015 there were nearly 470 million native speakers of Spanish living in 22 countries. If you add 21 million foreign language students world wide, and those with limited knowledge of Spanish, the number rises to 559 million. In fact, 6.7% of the world’s population already speaks Spanish and it is expected that this figure will reach 7.5% by 2030. Within four generations it is expected that 10% of the population will understand Spanish. Furthermore, Spanish is the third most commonly used language online, with 7.9% of Internet users communicating in Spanish.
A degree in Spanish and Latin American Studies from Dalhousie University will allow you to engage with this growing global community. Our courses provide a solid foundation for anyone wanting to experience the diversity of the Hispanic world. We offer language course that cater from beginners to the most advanced, as well as classes in translation, Spanish and Latin American civilization, history, culture, politics, literature and film.
You do not need to major in Spanish in order to take advantage of our program. Many students take out classes to complement degrees in other disciplines. Spanish language skills and knowledge of Latin America’s social and political history and culture can be tremendous assets to anyone studying international business or development, as well as anyone interested in working with government agencies or non-profit organizations.
Diplomas of Spanish as a Foreign Language (DELEs)
The Diploma of Spanish as a Foreign Language (DELE) is the official accreditation of the degree of fluency of the Spanish language, issued and recognized by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport.
The Instituto Cervantes is in charge of organizing the exams, while the University of Salamanca is in charge of the preparation, correction and final evaluation of all the tests. The exam tests your ability to read, write, speak and understand Spanish. There are six levels of DELEs offered that match the divisions determined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages:
Diploma de Español A1
Beginner level: You can understand and use daily expressions frequently used in any part of the Spanish-speaking world, aimed at satisfying immediate needs; asking and giving basic personal information about yourself and daily life, and interacting on a basic level with speakers, whenever they are speaking slowly and clearly and are willing to cooperate.
 1169
 
Diploma de Español A2
Elementary level: You are capable of understanding daily phrases and expressions frequently used related to areas of experience that are particularly relevant to you; basic information about yourself and your family, shopping, places of interest, occupations, etc.
Diploma de Español B1
Pre-intermediate/threshold level: You have sufficient knowledge of the language to allow control in situations
which require a basic use of the language.
Diploma de Español B2
Intermediate level: You have the necessary knowledge of the language to allow communication in everyday
situations which do not require specialized terms.
Diploma de Español C1
Upper intermediate/proficiency level: You have the ability to cope in common situations of daily life which require
a specialized use of the language.
Diploma de Español C2
Mastery/advanced level: You are able to communicate in all situations requiring advanced use of the language and
knowledge of cultural background.
The exams are offered in November and May in more than 50 countries around the world. The Department of Spanish and Latin American Studies organizes the examinations at Dalhousie every spring.
For more information about the format of the exam, dates and application deadlines, contact the Spanish Department DELE coordinator.

SPAN 3408 The Cuban Development Model
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course examines the evolution of the Cuban development model, from the Conquest and colonization by the Spanish to the reforms of the early 21st Century. The objective is to develop an understanding of the various development strategies employed by Cuba, particularly since the revolution of 1959. When asked about the Cuban development model, most people nowadays would say "tourism". Thirty years ago it was sugar--as it had been from the beginning if the 16th Century. In fact Cuba obtains most of its hard currency from medical-related services--mainly from the exportation of medical services, but also from the sale of sophisticated biotechnological products. Cuba's approach has evolved dramatically in the last two decades, and particular attention will be paid to this period.

 Introduction
Dalhousie enables you to study many aspects of theatre within the vibrant context of our multi-disciplinary Fountain School of Performing Arts. Our offerings range from classes in playwriting, directing, and theatre history, to an acting program entered by audition, to hands-on instruction in costume making, set design, props building, and more. Through our programs, students can develop expertise as designers, directors, performers, and audience members, in styles ranging from classical to contemporary.
The Bachelor of Arts in Theatre offers focused studies to prepare graduates for careers or further study in many areas, including acting, theatre studies, stage design, the fashion industry, and more. Through experiential learning, training in theatre teaches poise, discipline, creativity, collaboration, empathy, and the ability to think on one’s feet. These transferable skills are excellent preparation for many career paths in and beyond the performing arts.
We offer BA Honours degrees in Acting, Costume Studies, Stage Design & Technical Theatre, and Theatre Studies. These programs can sometimes be completed as a Combined Honours degree with another subject. We offer a two-year Diploma in Costume Studies. You can also pursue more general theatre degrees, including BA Major and Double Major. You can complete a Minor in Theatre to enhance your degree. You can also take courses in Theatre as electives to complement your studies in other disciplines.
The degree programs involve a curriculum of Theatre courses and a selection of other courses in different disciplines. The University has Academic Regulations which specify how these programs must be arranged. These regulations are all listed earlier in this Calendar, and prospective students should refer to them to become aware of the opportunities offered. There are a surprising number of different ways to arrange one’s studies; recommended here are the paths you can follow if Theatre is your primary interest.
Facilities
The Fountain School of Performing Arts is located in the Dalhousie Arts Centre. Theatre facilities include one proscenium theatre, two studios, and supporting workshops. Teaching spaces for costume studies are currently located off-campus. The School office is in Room 514 of the Arts Centre.
Because of the work involved, some theatre courses have a limited enrolment. All students wishing to take any practical course in Theatre should, therefore, first consult with the Fountain School.
PLEASE NOTE: Theatre by its nature requires evening work. Students, especially in Acting, Stage Design and Technical Theatre, and Costume courses, are advised not to undertake other evening commitments.
Degree Programs
In addition to the Fountain School requirements listed below, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Degree Requirements section of this calendar.
BA Honours in Theatre (Acting)
The main objective of the Acting Program is to satisfy the needs of those students who have decided to pursue a career as performers in the professional theatre. The program is progressive in nature, culminating in a company of student actors who perform in three theatrical productions in the Fountain School season in their fourth year. Third year students in the Acting Program will participate in the third play of the Fountain School season. Students may secure a spot in the Acting Program by auditioning EITHER directly out of high school before enrolling in their first year at Dalhousie OR upon completion of their first year. In both scenarios, they MUST complete THEA 1801 and 1802 (or equivalents at another university) in order to be eligible for the next three years of the program. In
  1190
 
addition to meeting degree requirements, students must achieve a B in all Acting Program courses, and must also be recommended by the Acting Faculty in order to advance to the next term's/year's course of study. The program provides these students with professional training and the benefits of a liberal-arts education at a major Canadian university. Honours students must maintain an average of at least B+ in all of their advanced Theatre courses.

Course Descriptions
PERF 1000 Writing About Performance
CREDIT HOURS: 3
What is performance, and who counts as a performer? Why is performance one of the most ancient and durable aspects of human community and interaction? Why do we adore certain performers and despise others? How are performers and their choices shaped by their societies, and vice versa? This course will explore these questions by looking at some of the vital roles fulfilled by theatrical, musical, and cinematic performers in global societies, both ancient and modern. Via readings of articles and plays as well as in-class screenings of film and video performances, it will consider the performer's role in shaping, embodying, and questioning societies' conceptions of beauty, morality, religious faith, gender, race, ethnicity, social class, and more.

THEA 3911 Gender in Theatre: A Cross-Cultural Survey
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course examines the roles gender has played in the shaping of world theatre alongside the roles the theatre has played in the shaping of various cultural conceptions of gender. By exploring plays and performances from Europe, North America, China, Japan, India, Iran and/or other traditions, we will strive to understand the ways in which various forms of representation reflect their cultures’ governing images of masculinity and femininity. In the process, we will interrogate the historical and cultural variability of the notion of
 1216
 
“gender” itself. The main objective of the course will be to ask how gender determines performers’ choices in various cultures, and to see how gender itself can actually be shaped by performance.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course offers students an opportunity to encounter some of the most provocative and challenging gender theory of recent years in relation to contemporary theatre, film and performance art. Students will read considerations of the relationship between gender, performance and identity by such authors as Hélène Cixous, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Judith Butler, Judith Halberstam, Peggy Phelan and Camille Paglia, among others. Alongside these works, we will examine contemporary performances from the popular to the oppositional. Through this intertextual exploration of theory and performance, we will aim to expand our understanding of the ways in gender roles are created, maintained, questioned and changed in contemporary culture(s).

THEA 4500 Canadian Theatre to 1968: Performing the Nation
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Early Canadian theatre offers a fascinating example of a colonial nation’s struggle to find its own dramatic voice in the face of powerful outside influences. This seminar course will explore the development of theatre in Canada from its roots in First Nations ritual and performance, to its encounters with British and European models and its eventual search for an independent identity via the Little Theatre movement, the Workers’ Theatre movement and the Dominion Drama Festival. The course will close with a consideration of the influential Massey Commission and the birth of the Stratford Festival, Canada’s first ‘world class’ theatre. Over the course of the term, special attention will be paid to the development of diverse dramatic traditions in French and English Canada. Drama by representative playwrights will be studied alongside primary sources in Canadian theatre history to give students an integrated perspective on the complex artistic and political debates that helped to determine the character of performance in Canada.

THEA 4501 Canadian Theatre Since 1968: Interrogating Identities
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This seminar course will examine the ongoing emergence of uniquely Canadian forms of theatre in the years since the Massey Commission asserted the need to foster Canada’s native talent. Topics to be considered will include: the controversial role of government subsidy and policy-making in Canadian culture; the differing models offered by the Stratford and Shaw Festivals, by the major regional theatres, and by ‘alternate’ and independent companies; the contrast between First Nations, English- and French- Canadian traditions; and the rise of the current ‘Fringe’ phenomenon. Drama by representative playwrights will be considered alongside post-colonial theory and primary sources in Canadian theatre history to help students consider what a genuinely ‘Canadian’ theatre might look like. Above all, the course offers an opportunity to consider the complex relationship between theatre and national identity: who are ‘we,’ and how might our theatre express or even shape ‘us’?

CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course will deal with the most recent developments in theatre, especially with those post-1970s trends that exercise a broad international influence. Each year, our investigation will begin with a brief look at postmodern theatre and cover topics such as performance art, physical theatre, and postdramatic theatre. The main focus of the course, however, will be dictated by what is currently happening on major stages across the world and may significantly change from one year to another. In the interest of a comprehensive and inclusive approach to the subject, both commercial and experimental theatres will be studied, and we will also examine some relevant works of criticism and theory. Since much of the material required for this course is not yet removed enough from our time to be accessible in scholarly literature, students should be prepared for alternative methods of research.

Double Majors and Combined Honours
The following degree programs are available to students interested in interdisciplinary studies where the larger number of majors credits is Computer Science: Bachelor of Science (120 credit hours) with Double Major, Bachelor of Science (120 credit hours) with Combined Honours, Bachelor of Arts (120 credit hours) Double Major and Bachelor of Arts (120 credit hours) Combined Honours.
Combined Honours
Students interested in taking honours in Computer Science and another subject as a combined program should consult the honours advisor through whom a suitable course of study can be arranged.
A combined honours program may well be an appropriate choice for many students. If a student is contemplating graduate work, it should be borne in mind that the work in either subject of a combined honours program may be insufficient for entry to a regular graduate program, and that a qualifying year may be necessary.
Students who wish to arrange interdisciplinary programs (with fields such as Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, and others) are invited to discuss their interests with the appropriate department and the Undergraduate Chair of the Faculty of Computer Science.
Minor in Computer Science for Non-Computer Science
Major BSc
The Minor in Computer Science is available to non-CS students registered in a 120 credit hour major and honours programs. Please see Minor in Computer Science.

CSCI 3101 Social, Ethical and Professional Issues in Computer Science
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Computers can enable people to do things that our present laws and policies were not formulated to cover (hacking, sharing files on the internet, and companies sharing data). In such cases, people need to be able to decide for themselves the best course of action, and defend such decisions. This course aims at developing the ethical reasoning skills and sensitivities that computer professionals will need to make good decisions and to justify them. The course includes a general introduction to ethical theories and their use in making and justifying decisions. We then consider various issues and case studies, illustrating the kinds of problems that can arise from the use and misuse of computers and technology: the responsibilities of computing professionals; ethics on the internet (hacking, computer crime, netiquette); privacy and information; intellectual property; social and political issues (digital divide, computers and work, the

Introduction
This program is no longer accepting applications for admission. of Applied Computer Science.
This program has been superceded by the Bachelor
Informatics is the multidisciplinary study of how people transform technology, and how technology transforms us. It lies at the intersection of people, technology and information systems and focuses on the expanding relationship between information systems and the daily lives of people, both at home and at work. Informatics helps develop new uses for information technology in order to design solutions that reflect the way people create, use and find information, and it takes into account the social, cultural and organizational settings in which those solutions will be used.
Informatics professionals have very diverse jobs. Some typical activities include:
• assess information needs of organizations
• manage information projects
• solve organizational information flow problems
• make software packages talk to each other
• model the information flows among a group of people
• design innovative user interfaces
• track health care resources
• design professional websites

The Faculty also offers a Bachelor of Applied Science in Food Science (admission suspended, pending review), and post-graduate studies at the master’s and doctoral level.
For students who are eligible, the Faculty of Engineering offers a Bachelor of Engineering Co-operative Education program that integrates academic study with university approved industrial experience. Graduation from this program requires satisfactory performance in both areas. The schedule of study and work terms varies according to the discipline, details of which are outlined in Section E of the Engineering curricula in this calendar.
The co-operative education system requires students to alternate periods of study with periods of university approved, full-time, paid employment. The period of employment is called a work term and is normally four months (16 weeks) in length. Some programs combine two or more four month work terms. Work terms have academic requirements that must be completed in addition to the requirements of the employer.
The co-op degree program covers almost five calendar years, comprising eight or nine terms (depending on the area of specialization) each consisting of about four months' duration of university work on campus which are pursued alternately with four-month terms of supervised training in the practical experiences fundamental to the development of the graduate engineer. In a typical program of study, the total time spent in academic study is the same as that encountered in the usual course of four academic years.
Graduation from the University is the beginning of a lifelong learning experience. After completion of formal studies leading to the Bachelor of Engineering degree, and being admitted as an Engineer in Training (EIT) by an Association of Professional Engineers in Canada, four years of suitable experience are required as a condition of admission to the profession of Engineering.
The practice of engineering is regulated, by statute, in all Canadian provinces and territories. To become a Professional Engineer you must satisfy the requirements of the licensing bodies. These requirements include a degree from an accredited program, successful completion of a professional practice (law and ethics) examination, and suitable experience. Accreditation of the degree programs by the CEAB is the mechanism by which graduates qualify for registration as Professional Engineers without the need to undertake additional examinations in specific technical subject areas. The BEng programs described in this calendar have been specifically designed to satisfy the criteria of the Profession and are evaluated regularly by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) of Engineers Canada. The Faculty will not graduate any student who does not meet these requirements because this would jeopardize accreditation for the program. The department responsible for the appropriate program will use these requirements in determining the suitability of student elective course selections. The baccalaureate programs in all disciplines are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.

Students who have completed equivalent university studies elsewhere may also be admitted subject to Dalhousie University Regulations.
Please refer to the Graduate and Professional Calendar for details of graduate programs offered by the Faculty of Engineering.
Academic Regulations
Students are reminded that the academic regulations stated in the calendar are abridged for reference. In addition to the Academic Regulations section of this calendar and the regulations stated below, the current Faculty of Engineering Working Rules also apply to all students.
Courses on Letters of Permission
The academic program for a student will normally contain a maximum of two courses on a letter of permission.
Course Grades
A student must achieve a grade of D or greater in each course of the curriculum and satisfy the regulations set out herein in order to graduate. Where Faculty regulations permit, a student who achieves a grade of FM in a required course may write a supplementary examination to attempt to raise the grade to D or greater. If the grade is not raised to at least D by means of a supplementary examination or if a supplementary examination is not permitted, the student must repeat the course. See also Supplementals.
The FM grade will be issued to students with numerical marks in the range 46-49.9%, if a supplemental examination is available in the course.
A student is permitted to repeat a failed mandatory course only once. In the case of a failed elective course, a student may choose either to repeat the course or to substitute another elective course in lieu of the failed course. In the case of a substituted course only one such substitution is allowed. A student will be academically dismissed if the grade achieved in the repeated mandatory course or the repeated elective course or the substituted course is less than D.
    1277
 
Readmission After Academic Dismissal
A student who has been academically dismissed only once from their program may apply to be readmitted to the same program after a minimum of eight months from the time of dismissal, or, such a student may apply to be admitted to a different engineering program starting immediately. Readmission may be granted by the Faculty on the recommendation of the Department concerned. A department may readmit a student who has been academically dismissed, subject to special academic conditions set by the department, which are based on an evaluation of the student’s academic record. See also Academic Dismissal.
Scholarships
Only those students who are registered for a full load of courses as measured by the curriculum of the program concerned will be eligible for scholarships and awards in the Faculty of Engineering.
Supplementary Examinations
Eligibility:
Supplemental examinations may be offered to students who:
1. Have received a FM grade in the course (see Course Grades).
2. Are on academic probation and have received a course grade less than C, in an attempt to raise the
student’s term GPA to at least 2.0.
A student who is on Academic Dismissal is not eligible to write a supplemental examination. Only one
supplemental examination will be permitted per session.
Marks:
The supplemental examination mark will normally replace the final examination mark in calculating the course grade. The course grade resulting from a supplemental examination will replace the original course grade for all purposes.
Availability:
Supplemental examinations will not necessarily be available for all courses. If a 1000-level or 2000-level course is offered in the Faculty of Engineering, and it that course has a final examination in the formal examination period, the course will offer supplemental examinations for eligible students. For all engineering courses, students will be informed by the instructor, at the beginning of a course, if a supplemental exam is available.
Dates:
Supplemental examinations will normally be held in late August prior to the fall term, early January in the winter term and early May in the summer term.
In the case of 1000-level and 2000-level supplemental examinations, the supplemental examination will be written at the first supplemental examination date following the final examination date. For 3000-level and 4000-level courses which offer supplemental examinations, the exam will be held at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled study term for the student’s program. If the next study term is a fall term, the supplemental examinations will be held in late August, prior to the start of term.
Supplemental examinations for a particular course must be written at the first scheduled date, as outlined above, and cannot be postponed or carried forward to a later session.
Repeating Students
If changes are made in the curriculum, repeating students will be required to satisfy the new curriculum.
Auditing a Course
See definition of “audit student”.
   1278
 
Students who are registered for a degree in the Faculty must have the approval of the Faculty to audit a course. Such approval can be obtained by submitting a written request to the Dean, who will refer the matter to the Faculty for a decision.
Students who are not registering for a degree in the Faculty must obtain the approval of the Department to audit a course.
Reporting of absences from Assessments
1. This policy applies to all courses in the Faculty of Engineering.
2. All reporting of medical excuses, or self-reporting of absences, is to the Associate Dean of Engineering.
3. Every syllabus shall specify how missed work will be accommodated.
4. “Final coursework” is excluded.
5. Medical notes are required for missing any work that is considered “Final Coursework”. When medical
notes are required, the following Faculty of Engineering policy shall be followed.
Medical Notes
Students who miss final examinations or final coursework for medical reasons must submit medical notes to the Undergraduate Studies Office for consideration by the Associate Dean of Engineering. This must be done within seven days of the submission deadline or exam date in question. The medical note is verified, and the professor advised if they may submit the grade of ILL before arrangements for special examinations or rewrites may be made. Meanwhile, the student will be given the grade earned in the class, minus the value of the missed examination.
6. A student who misses a deferred examination, shall not be given another deferred examination – in this case, medical evidence can be presented to justify a permanent grade of “ILL”.

Introduction
The engineering program is designed for students who have completed senior matriculation (Nova Scotia Grade XII) including mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and rank well in their course. Students may be admitted with advanced placement.
At Dalhousie, students benefit from our unique approach to undergraduate engineering education. Renowned for innovation in education, the unique undergraduate engineering curricula at Dalhousie University provide a sound basis in Mathematics and pure Science and in Engineering Science and Design, that are a foundation for success in any engineering career. A substantial part of the work of the first and second years is common to all programs. The content of many of these courses will change very little over the course of an engineer’s career; they will become a sound basis of life-long learning.
The Faculty of Engineering has five engineering departments and one service department, the Department of Engineering Mathematics and Internetworking. Civil and Resource Engineering administers degree programs in the disciplines of Civil, Environmental and Mineral Resource Engineering. The Department of Process Engineering and Applied Science administers a degree program in the discipline of Chemical Engineering. The Mechanical
  1279
 
Engineering department administers degree programs in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Engineering. The remaining departments are Electrical and Industrial.
At the end of Year 1, students apply for discipline placement indicating the order of their preferences. The Faculty of Engineering will inform students who have met the criteria of promotion from Year 1 to Year 2 of their conditional placement in one of the accredited programs. The curriculum for each of the basic programs combines required ‘core’ subjects essential to the field, and ‘elective’ subjects permitting considerable diversity in individual programs of study. An important part of the curriculum is a series of Complementary Studies courses. The curriculum for the first two years of Engineering at Dalhousie is indicated below. Students should refer to the appropriate departmental chapter of the calendar once a field of specialization has been determined for subsequent years.
Admission to an Engineering Discipline
A student must apply to be admitted into one of the engineering disciplines. Application must be made by April 30 of any year, for conditional acceptance into year two of a specified engineering program.
Every engineering discipline has a defined maximum enrollment; therefore places are assigned on a competitive basis. The criterion for this competition is the average grade over all credits completed to date in the core curriculum of the Diploma of Engineering.
The procedure is as follows:
1. By April 30, each student must specify ordered preferences for five engineering disciplines. The application is for conditional acceptance into year two of an engineering discipline.
2. Any student who has completed all of the entry requirements for an engineering discipline, with a GPA of 3.30 or better, will be guaranteed a place in that engineering discipline.
3. In a single competition, students with a GPA greater than or equal to 2.00 and less than 3.30 will be assigned conditional places (year two) in engineering disciplines, proceeding in strict order of GPA, subject to discipline capacities.
4. Any student with a GPA of less than 2.00 will not be admitted to a discipline.
Humanities Electives
Some disciplines of engineering require a student to do one or more humanities electives. In such a case, the definition of a humanities elective shall be as follows:
Humanities would normally be in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and may not include signifiant science, technical or mathematics content, nor may they include economics or language acquisition. Departments
which may have suitable courses include: Arabic, Bioethics, Canadian Studies, Chinese, Classics, Contemporary Studies, Creative Writing, Early Modern Studies, English, European Studies, French, Gender and Women's Studies, German, History of Science and Technology, History, International Development Studies, Italian, Journalism, King's Foundation Year Program, Law, Leisure Studies, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, Religious Studies, Russian Studies, Social Work, Sociology and Social Anthropology, Spanish and Latin American Studies, Sustainability, Theatre.
BSc/BEng
Students who meet the admission requirements for the Bachelor of Science program and the Bachelor of Engineering program are eligible to select this concurrent degree option. Students wishing specific advice should consult the Assistant Dean, Faculty of Science and the Associate Dean, Faculty of Engineering. Students accepted will complete the 90 credit hours BSc and the first two years of engineering studies leading to the Diploma in Engineering concurrently in a period of three calendar years. At the end of the three year period, both the degree and the diploma will be awarded to successful candidates. This opportunity should appeal to students with career objectives in multi-disciplinary fields such as Biomedical Engineering, Environmental Science, or Materials Science
 1280
 
(among others). It is thus possible to complete the requirements for the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Engineering degrees concurrently in a time period of five years in total (or up to six years for Co-op programs).
BA/BEng
Students wishing to do so may complete the 90 credit hours BA degree program and the first two years of engineering studies leading to the Diploma in Engineering concurrently in a period of three calendar years. At the end of the three year period, both the degree and the diploma will be awarded to successful candidates. It is thus possible to complete the requirements for the Bachelor of Engineering and the Bachelor of Arts degrees concurrently in a time period of five years in total (or up to six years for Co-op programs).
Courses in the fourth and fifth years are those required to finish the Bachelor of Engineering degree.
Diploma of Engineering
Students who have successfully completed the academic study program in the first four terms in any of the disciplines may be eligible to apply for the Diploma of Engineering. This means a student must have a minimum GPA of 2.0, and have completed, with a minimum grade of D, the required courses as specified in the discipline curriculum.

The Faculty of Engineering offers a Bachelor of Engineering Co-operative Education program (BEng Co-op) that allows students to alternate career focused work terms with study terms and receive a Co-op degree designation upon graduation. Co-op enables students to apply what they learn in class to real-world work situations and then apply what they learn at work to their classroom studies, thereby enriching their learning. It also helps students to learn more about their career options by test-driving different work environments before they graduate. Graduation from this program requires satisfactory performance in both areas. The schedule of study and work terms varies according to the discipline, details of which are outlined below.
1
 1283
 
BEng Co-op is a selective program. Students interested in participating must apply, via the S.I.T.E. Co-op (http://www.dal.ca/faculty/site.html).
The Study and Work Schedule
The co-operative system requires students to alternate periods of study with periods of university approved, full- time, paid employment. The period of employment is called a work term and is normally four months (16 weeks) in length. Some programs combine two or more four-month work terms. Work terms have academic requirements that must be completed in addition to the requirements of the employer.
Each discipline has a specific work and study term schedule which students are required to follow (see the study and work sequence chart below). Work terms do not begin until third year of the program. All programs end on an academic term rather than a work term to allow for the formal integration of workplace and classroom learning.

 Introduction
The Chemical Engineering program prepares students for careers in the chemical and process industries and in a variety of related fields. These encompass, among others, the traditional areas of environmental control, plastics and polymers, pulp and paper, instrumentation and process control, petrochemicals, petroleum and natural gas processing, and energy conversion and utilization, as well as the growing fields of biotechnology, food processing, composite materials, corrosion and protective coatings, and manufacture of microelectronic components.
The responsibilities assumed by Chemical Engineers include a wide range of activities such as research and development of novel products and processes, the design, development and operation of process plants, and management of technical operations and sales.
The curriculum is designed to provide the student with a broad background in the underlying sciences of Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. This is then combined with a detailed knowledge of engineering principles
 1288
 
and practice, along with a good appreciation of social and economic factors. Laboratory involvement is considered an important component of the students’ education. Emphasis in the laboratory is placed on team work and on the development of problem-identification and problem-solving skills. The Department stresses the preparation of students for independent work and the development of interpersonal skills necessary for professional engineers.
Research opportunities leading to master’s and doctoral degrees are offered in a wide range of topics within the Department as well as in conjunction with other departments and a number of research centres on the campus. Detailed information regarding the graduate program can be obtained from the Department.
Undergraduate students have the option of following a co-op program (five years) or a non-co-op program (four years).

Introduction
Civil engineering deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the infrastructure of human civilization. Civil engineers are engaged in addressing two fundamental questions. First, how do we protect our society and its infrastructure from the impacts of the natural environment? Second, what are the impacts of society and its nfrastructure on our natural environment? The infrastructure considered may be at the feasibility or the design stage, or already in existence.
First, humans need protection from the elements to thrive on this planet. With the growth of centers of population and highly organized societies, the need for very diverse kinds of ‘shelter’ has also dramatically increased – now routinely including hospitals, schools, skyscrapers, factories, and theatres. Cities and other centres require energy and must be connected, giving rise to the need for such ancillary infrastructure as hydro-dams, road networks, bridges, and airports. The results of the design work of the civil engineer are therefore quite visible and a source of enduring pride. However, nature sometimes deals harshly with our infrastructure, striking it with hurricanes and/or ice storms. Even if the basic designs are sound, a significant maintenance effort by engineers who are knowledgeable about the basis for the original designs is implied.
Second, Civil engineers must recognize that humans are biological entities that consume resources and generate waste. They need water, they generate wastewater. They buy consumer goods, they generate solid waste. How can we ensure that our water is pure, and that it stays pure? How can we ensure that the waste from our cities is handled in such a way that damage to the environment and risks to our own health are minimized, or perhaps even nullified? Nature metes out drought and heat, floods and freezing temperatures. How can we prepare society for such eventualities? The fact that our water and other planetary resources asre also finite, can be badly or well- managed, and have been abused in the past all raise additional questions and endeavours that come under the purview of civil engineering. That the undergraduate civil engineering program at Dalhousie University has two
 1332
 
options (the Infrastructure Option and Earth and Environment Option) is a reflection of the long-standing relevance and importance of the role of Civil engineers in addressing the above questions.
Although civil engineering is only one among many engineering disciplines available at Dalhousie, as an applied science it is characterized by exceptional technical diversity, great breadth and depth of subject matter, and a propensity for proactively addressing the practical needs of society. It is therefore natural that a BEng. in civil engineering is an excellent way to start ‘life in the universe’. It is often used by our graduates as a launching pad for post-graduate studies in very diverse realms of study. Civil engineers are found in all levels of government, in private consulting companies, in public utilities, in global enterprises, and in a wide range of fields that has included technology management, business administration, and even biomedical engineering.
The Department of Civil and Resource Engineering has about 60 graduate students. They are involved in a wide- range of projects that will affect engineering practice. Our experienced and diversely-trained faculty members therefore have many research outcomes upon which they can draw when coming to the classroom or the laboratory and in doing so are eminently able to keep the undergraduate program current and modern.
A. Infrastructure Option
In this option, the following aspects of civil engineering are emphasized:
structural engineering and design, materials of construction (steel, concrete, timber, masonry, asphalt, fibre reinforced polymers), transportation engineering, construction management, and soil mechanics.
B. Earth and Environment Option
In this option the following aspects of civil engineering receive some emphasis:
environmental engineering, water and wastewater treatment, water resources and hydrogeology, geo- environmental engineering, and waste management.

Introduction
No other branch of engineering can claim to have such an impact on modern society as Electrical and Computer Engineering. The ease, speed and precision by which electrical energy and electrical signals can be transmitted, transformed and controlled has influenced not only our daily life, but has also changed the course of many other disciplines. Over only a few decades, Electrical and Computer Engineering has grown to a multi-branch discipline with significant applications in the areas of power systems, communication systems, microelectronics,
photonics, computers and biomedical applications. This rapid growth, coupled with major advances in technology and material science, has made the field very dynamic, and poses a challenge to the student, to the educator and to the practicing Electrical and Computer Engineer for the breadth of its activities.
The Electrical and Computer Engineering curriculum is based on the physical and mathematical principles which constitute the unchanging foundation of the discipline. Courses apply these foundational principles to state-of-the- art applications within specialized areas of the field.
In the final year, technical elective courses are provided to enable the student to obtain a deeper, more detailed understanding of current technology in a field of interest. Technical electives may also be chosen from listed courses offered by other Departments. In addition, during the final year, the students work on a senior capstone project in teams of three to four. The project involves analysis, design and implementation to solve a realistic electrical or computer engineering problem. The projects are submitted by professionals in local industry or research facilities who then provide supervision in conjunction with an assigned Faculty Advisor.
Laboratory sessions form an integral part of most Electrical and Computer Engineering courses. These sessions are conducted in laboratories housed on campus.
Students enrolled in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Degree Programs may take part in Co-Operative Education where they can apply for up to three four-month work placements in industry. Students participating in the Co-op Program will require two years and four months to complete their degree while students not in the Co- op Program can finish in one year and eight months.
Students participating in our program may pursue either the Electrical or the Computer options as listed below. Additionally, the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department offers an exciting Specialization in Biomedical Engineering.

 Introduction
Industrial Engineers design systems to enable people and society to improve productivity, efficiency, effectiveness and quality. All engineers work at planning, designing, implementing and controlling the systems that enable people to use technology. The systems that industrial engineers design are broad and are characterized by a need to integrate both the physical and decision making capabilities of humans with all other aspects of the system design. Problems range from the design of a work method and work station, to the design of a factory layout and methods of controlling the flow of materials on the factory floor, to the design of an overall corporate plan involving materials procurement, production, inventory and distribution. The idea of a factory is also extended to include communications, systems, energy systems, health care systems, municipal systems, transportation systems; in fact all systems that are essential to the functioning of modern society. To facilitate effective decision- making and achieve high performance in areas such as scheduling, inventory and quality control, industrial engineers are often required to design and implement computer based information systems.
Human behaviour and capabilities are key elements in the systems industrial engineers work with. In designing the layout of a production line for an automobile manufacturer, the checkout counter for a supermarket, the organization of work flow for a bank or the materials handling system for a steel plant, the engineer must consider both physical requirements and cost parameters, and the physiological and behavioural performance of the
human operators. The industrial engineer has a dual role, both to extend human capability to operate, manage and control the overall production system, and to ensure the safety and well being of those working in the system.
Design and development of these systems requires the unique background of the industrial engineer. The process of engineering always starts with measurement. Where other engineers might measure temperatures, pressures, or loads, the industrial engineer measures the time of a work cycle, dollar value of expenditures, rates of machine failures, and demand for finished goods. Usually the mathematical analysis must take into account risk and uncertainty to a larger extent than in other engineering fields. Computer simulation and optimization are often required. The concepts and techniques found in the Industrial Engineering curriculum have been selected to assist the student to develop the skills that meet the specific challenges of systems which involve managerial activities.
Students begin the Industrial Engineering program with a background in engineering fundamentals studied during their initial two years. In the latter portion of the IE program, they are introduced to the fundamental approaches of work place design and operations research, while at the same time enhancing their mathematical and computer background. Later, more advanced modelling approaches are examined together with courses more directly related to the management process. Production scheduling, inventory control, quality management and plant
 1357
 
layout are studied, as are the factors which influence human performance. Students are provided with the opportunity to study such areas as manufacturing, service systems, or maintenance through the Department’s elective course offerings.
In their final year, all students undertake a major design project. Projects are drawn from companies or institutions outside the University and are treated as a consulting assignment. Students are evaluated on their ability to achieve an innovative solution by drawing upon the analytical skills developed throughout their program of studies. They must also, of course, satisfy the practical requirements of the client.
Job opportunities for industrial engineers are both plentiful and widely based. Former graduates are currently practicing industrial engineering in areas ranging from semi-conductor manufacturing and airlines, to utilities and hospitals. Invariably, the work assigned is original in its nature, demanding that the industrial engineer be creative in applying his or her many abilities to achieve the best solution. Managers require such results if they are to keep their costs under control in an increasingly competitive world. This requirement will sustain the high demand for industrial engineers well into the future.

 Introduction
Metals and materials are found in every aspect of society today. Materials have always been central to the advancement of civilization so it is not surprising that entire eras are named after them (bronze age, iron age). The importance of developing new, advanced materials is truly a global issue with societal demands for things such as more fuel efficient vehicles and faster computer processors reaching all time highs. Materials Engineers are the driving force behind such developments, having an unsurpassed understanding of the respective structure, properties and processing of materials. Consequently, graduates are employed in practically all industries. Principles amongst these are primary metal production, automotive, aerospace, government research establishments and consulting firms.
The program has been designed to give students extensive coverage of this highly unique field which in itself is very broad. The principal branches of Materials Engineering in which students receive instruction include (i) Extractive Processing of Materials, (ii) Structure of Materials, and (iii) Mechanical Properties and Testing of Materials; usually the graduating engineer chooses to specialize in one of these three. Students learn about all of the major courses of materials including metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites -graduates are true “Materials Experts.” In doing so, the respective curricula are designed to provide in-depth knowledge of engineering and more importantly, extensive coverage of discipline-specific areas.
Students are able to obtain a Bachelor of Materials Engineering with Co-Op distinction in two years following the completion of a Diploma in Engineering. There are two Co-op programs offered in Materials Engineering. One is a Bachelor of Engineering, the other a combined BEng/MASc Degree. The undergraduate curriculum is the same for both programs.
The BEng/MASc was developed in light of the program's strong commitment to research and to permit the identification of students interested in graduate studies before they completed their undergraduate courses. In this regard, all faculty members are actively involved in international research and development initiatives. Consequently, students may also choose to pursue Master's and Doctoral degrees in Materials engineering at Dalhousie in many technically challenging fields of global importance. Included are ceramic and metal matrix composites, automotive alloys, aerospace materials, electronic materials, corrosion, wear, and near-net-shape materials processing technologies.

 Introduction
Mechanical Engineering covers a very broad field of professional activity in such areas as land, sea, air, and space transportation; primary and secondary manufacturing industries; energy supply, conversion and utilization; environmental control; and industrial management. In these areas, the Mechanical Engineer may become involved with design, construction, operation, development, research, planning, sales and management.
The curriculum is designed to develop an understanding of the fundamental principles of Mechanical Engineering through lecture, tutorial, and laboratory activities. Well-instrumented laboratories in thermofluids, energy conversion, stress analysis, vibrations, and control systems provide experience in measurements and applications, to ensure a thorough understanding and appreciation of the subject matter. Courses in mathematics, and various non-technical subjects are offered to broaden the student’s outlook and understanding of the profession.
Laboratory involvement is considered an important component of mechanical engineering students’ education. Emphasis in the laboratory is placed on project work in which design, development and testing are combined in term projects. The laboratory facilities include extensive equipment which is available for use by both
 1375

undergraduate and graduate students. Measurement techniques and interpretation of test data are emphasized in the laboratories.
Most undergraduate laboratories use high-speed PC-based digital data acquisition and control systems with graphical interfaces for lab experiments and computations, and the Department has several advanced computer graphics systems.
A design project is an integral part of the senior year curriculum. This involves the student in the original design of a machine or system. Generally, the material learned in several courses must be applied in an imaginative way to achieve the required objective. Non-credit machine-shop practice courses are available to aid the design and construction of projects. Many design projects are sponsored by industry. Most projects involve hardware and typically result in construction and testing of prototypes.
Postgraduate studies in the Department are concentrated in the areas of renewable energy, conversion and storage, stress analysis, heat transfer, multi-phase flow, fluid and thermal power, dynamics of rotating machines, robotics, MEMS and computer aided design and manufacturing. Research and project master’s degrees as well as the doctoral degree are offered.

Combined BEng - MASc Program Guide
1. Program Entrance Requirements
To be eligible to enter the Combined BEng/MASc Program, a student must be able to demonstrate an overall average of 70% based on the subjects in the first three academic terms of the Materials Engineering Program.
Since the first two academic terms of the BEng and combined BEng/MASc Programs are common, students enrolled in the BEng Program may apply for entrance into the combined degree program at any time before the beginning of the seventh academic term.
2. Financial Support
All students accepted into the BEng/MASc Program will be eligible for financial assistance beginning at the start of the seventh academic term. The assistance will be spread over the remainder of the academic terms and may have a total value of approximately $15,000.
Part of the financial assistance is derived from money obtained to further specific research objectives on which the student is expected to work for his or her Master’s Thesis. The remainder of the financial support is normally derived from assigned duties as Part-Time Teaching Assistants. A course work Master’s Program (MEng) can be followed but the amount of financial assistance will be considerably reduced.
3. Maintenance of Standing
In order to retain standing in the Combined BEng/MASc Program, students must continue to maintain an academic average of B-. Failing this, a student may obtain a BEng Degree only by completing the required courses, but will not be eligible for further financial assistance from the Department. However, on graduation should the student attain an average of B, he/she may be eligible to pursue graduate studies in the department.
4. Scholarships
Students in the Combined BEng/MASc Program are encouraged to apply for the usual scholarships and bursaries in order to partially augment the financial support received. Contact the Department for details.
5. Combined BEng/MASc Scheduling

 Introduction
The Department of Process Engineering and Applied Science prepares students for professional careers in a wide range of fields related to the process industries. Process engineers and scientists research and develop new materials and processes to meet a specific need or create a value-added product. In an industrial setting, they optimize systems and processes so that they are not only environmentally sustainable, but are also inherently safe, produce high-quality products, and are cost effective.
Process Engineering graduates are actively being employed in the bioprocess industry (food, fiber, pharmaceutical, ...), materials process industry (metals, ceramics, composites, ...), petrochemical process industry (oil, gas, plastics, ...), energy engineering (energy efficiency, renewable sources ...), and several others.
The Department of Process Engineering and Applied Science offers one undergraduate degree: a B.Eng. in Chemical Engineering with both co-op and non-co-op options.
There is ongoing research in the Department that provides opportunities for graduate studies leading to master's and doctoral degrees. Consult the Graduate Calendar, Dalhousie University for more details on these graduate programs.

Policy Statement on Interprofessional Health Education
Students in the Faculties of Dentistry, Health and Medicine are required to participate in interprofessional health education activities. These activities, together with specific program requirements, are currently evolving and in transition and are integrated into the curricula of individual programs. Participation is mandatory. The objective of interprofessional education in the Faculty of Health include developing:
• knowledge and understanding of, and respect for, the expertise, roles and values of other health and human service professionals.
• understanding the concept and practice of patient/client/family-centred care.
• effective communication, teamwork and leadership skills applied in interprofessional contexts.
• positive attitudes related to the value of collaboration and teamwork in health and human service
contexts.
• an understanding, from a multi-disciplinary perspective, of the Canadian health and social systems, the
legal and regulatory foundation of professional practice, how health and human service institutions are organized and operate, and how different health and human service professions contribute to the systems and institutions.
Students in the entry-to-practice programs in the Faculty of Health, are required to maintain enrolment in IPHE 4900 (see calendar section on Health Professions Interprofessional Health Education) for the duration of their studies. Successful completion of this course is a requirement for graduation in these programs, and will be recognized further with the awarding of a special Certificate in Interprofessional Collaboration; to be presented by the Faculty of Health. For more information, students should contact their specific school/college.
Statement Regarding Criminal Records Check
   1413

The Faculty of Health of Dalhousie University does not require a Criminal Records Check or other screening procedure (e.g., Vulnerable Sector Screen) as a condition of admission into its programs. However, students should be aware that such record checks or other screening procedures may be required by facilities outside the University used for clinical, fieldwork or co-op placements or experiences related to an academic class assignment, which, in some instances, may be a requirement for graduation. It is the student’s responsibility to have such procedures completed.
Such facilities may refuse to accept students on the basis of information contained in the record check or other screening procedures. If the student is unable to complete a clinical requirement due to a failure to meet the record check or screening requirements of the facility, or if the student is refused access to the facility on the basis of the information provided, such a student may fail the class, and as a result, in some instances, may not be eligible for progression or graduation.
Students should check with their School/College for details concerning any record checks or screening requirements relevant to clinical, fieldwork, or placements in their particular program. Note that facility requirements may change from time to time and are beyond the control of the University.
Students should also be aware that some professional regulatory bodies may require a satisfactory record check as a condition of professional licensure.
Practicum/Fieldwork Placements Outside Halifax
Students enrolled in programs of study in the Faculty of Health (Health Sciences, Nursing, Health and Human Performance, Social Work and Pharmacy) are advised that they may have to do some or all of their required clinical education/fieldwork at sites outside Halifax, and hence may have to incur additional personal expenses for travel and temporary accommodation.
In some situations, sites may require a payment to the site for support of clinical education/fieldwork supervision, and some sites may require separate disability insurance in lieu of eligibility for Worker Compensation coverage. Such costs are the responsibility of the student.

 Regulations
Students registered in the courses of the Disability Management Certificate Program (CDM) are bound by the University and Faculty regulations in the same manner as all Dalhousie students. The University and Faculty of Health regulations are found in the University Regulations section of the Dalhousie University Calendar. Academic regulations are found in the Academic Regulations section of the Calendar. It is the responsibility of each CDM student to become familiar with both the University and Faculty of Health regulations.
Please make note of the “Acceptable Use Policy” found in the University Regulations section of the Dalhousie Calendar. Because of the distance learning component of this Program, students should pay particular attention to regulations designed to respect the rights of other computer users.
Course Grades
The minimum passing grade for all of the CDM courses is 50%. A course may be repeated only once, with a maximum of two repeated courses permitted. A student who fails the same course twice will not be awarded the Certificate.
Appeals
On occasion, conflict or disagreement on final grades or evaluative procedures may arise. All students are expected to familiarize themselves with the processes available to them for academic appeals. Timeliness is of the essence for presentation and consideration of all appeals and, in all instances, the first level of appeal will be at the informal level.
Formal appeals of a final grade or a procedural problem must follow the regulations as stated in the University Calendar and such appeals will only be considered after failure to resolve the issue at the informal level has occurred. Students who do not follow these procedures will automatically forfeit their right to further consideration of their appeal and the original decision will remain in effect.
Informal Process
For each instance, the student and instructor, with guidance for the CDM Program Coordinator, are expected to attempt to resolve the matter informally within 15 days of the matter giving rise to the appeal.
 1417
 
Formal Process
If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the student my initiate a formal appeal by following the procedures set down in the University Calendar (see Regulation 16.7 of the Academic Regulations section for appeals of grades, and the Academic Regulations section for the Faculty of Health appeals process.
Note that both the Dalhousie University Calendar and the Faculty of Health policies appear on the Dalhousie University website.

Certificate in Disability Management
The School of Occupational Therapy offers a Certificate in Disability Management (CDM) Program specifically designedtoeducationandengagestudentsintheelementsofdisabilitymanagement. Disabilitymanagement team members provide effective, efficient and safe co-ordination of services needed to help injured or ill individuals achieve their maximum level of functioning, and facilitate their ability to remain at or return to work. Graduates of the CDM Program will typically work as disability case managers, insurance case managers, return to work facilitators, vocational rehabilitation consultants, vocational counsellors, or employee wellness program administrators.
People in the field of disability management come from many different professional backgrounds such as education, human resources, kinesiology, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and social work. More and more organizations are recognizing the important role that disability management can play, with benefits of an effective disability management program including reducing cost due to less work disruptions, enhanced employee morale and sense of belonging, as well as improved manpower consistency. Practical applications of disability management have been made in different sectors of occupational activity such as administrative, industrial, service provision, technical and business. With so many multi-faceted aspects characterizing the field of disability management, the Dalhousie program draws on many bodies of knowledge spanning theoretical and practical application.
Program Overview
The overall goal of the CDM Program is to educate individuals with integrated knowledge and skills necessary to provide quality disability management services, through recognizing and understanding the dynamic interaction between disability and work performance. Upon completion of the CDM Program, students will be able to demonstrate and apply skills and competencies in the areas of:
 1418
 
1. Foundations of Disability Management
2. Communication and Professional Relationships
3. Return to Work and Case Management
4. Policies, Ethics and Legal Issues
The CDM Program is made up of four academic undergraduate three credit hours courses that are taught completely online. These courses are normally taken as electives by students currently enrolled in an academic program at Dalhousie or another Canadian University. However, students not enrolled in a university program can pursue the CDM by applying as a Special Student Undergraduate. Any student interested in taking courses in the CDM Program must register through the Registrar's Office. Admission requirements vary based on previous education and the intended program of study at Dalhousie. The Registrar's Office can help guide students as to the eligibility for admission to specific Dalhousie programs.

The main goal of the course is to introduce students to the ways in which health promotion research questions, methods and ethics, as well as health policies, vary depending upon the specific international context (local and national). A comparative analysis will be undertaken of the disparities in health/well-being between (and within) developed and developing countries while considering the historical development of underdevelopment. Each year the students will choose from a number of cases two that will be examined in- depth by the class. Students will choose from among a variety of key global health issues (e.g. tobacco addiction, health issues for migrant workers, HIV/AIDS and nutrition). Focus will be placed on the social determinants of these health issues/problems, and the types of health promotion research and policy issues needed to address these health problems within particular geographical contexts/countries. One of the central tenets of the course is how societies are organized, and the way in which resources are invested and whose interests the investments serve, affect the health of individuals and populations within the society.

KINE 1108 Psychology and Physical Activity
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Physical inactivity is widely recognized as a lifestyle associated with considerable health risk. The challenge of increasing the level of physical activity in the population requires an in-depth understanding of the individual and environmental factors that either promote or inhibit regular activity. Accordingly, this introductory course will provide students with the fundamental knowledge of how psychological concepts are related to physical activity participation and health. The main focus is to provide (a) a basic understanding of various social-psychological concepts and principles involved in health and exercise psychology, and (b) to see how these concepts and principles might be translated into promoting health and wellness via physical activity participation. Core concepts include the basics of psychology research, theories, motivation, adherence, and behaviour modification.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
An understanding of the place and potential of leisure for individual Canadians and Canadian society is essential if we are to move beyond the conviction that only labor is to be valued. This course introduces students to concepts including play, sport, recreation and leisure; how they are viewed and valued in our society; and how they relate to health and well-being. The content provides an overview of leisure service delivery, public access to leisure opportunities, variations in leisure involvement due to social and cultural differences, and issues that are important for future leisure service professionals. Students will have the opportunity to increase writing, verbal communication and computer skills, and learn how to use the library effectively. Participation in a professional conference is a component of the learning experience of this course. The students are required to participate in an Orientation to the recreation program that will provide the environment that will create a learning community for the next three to four years of their education experience.

LEIS 3360 Analysis of Leisure Service Delivery Settings
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Reflections on the twentieth century reveal tremendous changes in the way people live. These changes have impacted work, family structure, and mental and physical well-being, and signal the importance and need of opportunities for leisure pursuits. Leisure is one of life's greatest gifts — an important dimension influencing the quality of an individual's life. Similarly, leisure enhances the quality of life available to a society or culture. The growth of the leisure industry reflects the ever increasing value that individuals are placing upon leisure in their lives. It is essential for the student of recreation management to know and understand that leisure delivery and life satisfaction are dependent upon effective organizational analysis and the quality of services provided. This course presents historical and contemporary concepts of the diverse types of agencies and institutions providing leisure services in North America. It will review the nature and effectiveness of services provided by various leisure service agencies in the private, private non-profit, commercial recreation, travel and tourism sectors of the leisure industry. It will seek to (a) evaluate the political, social, physical and economic impact on each of the sectors, (b) determine ways of assessing the assurance of quality service delivery, and (c) find ways of motivating improvements in the identifying and meeting of consumers' leisure needs, today and in the future. Consideration is also given to organizational structure and governance within leisure service settings, and the incorporation of the “benefits based approach” to leisure service delivery.

Bachelor of Health Science Degree Program
BHSc programs are four-year degree programs that provide integrated courses of study including both theory and practice. There is also a post-diploma offering for practicing professionals. (See section on Post-Diploma)
The School of Health Sciences offers degrees in five professional disciplines:
• BHSc in Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound
• BHSc in Nuclear Medicine Technology
• BHSc in Radiological Technology
• BHSc in Respiratory Therapy
• and BHSc in Medical Laboratory Technology (post diploma only)
 1474
 
Students follow an integrated curriculum that includes core, interdisciplinary and discipline-specific courses. Clinical practica are included in each year of study requiring a full-time commitment in the May-June time period.
In order to accommodate all third year Respiratory Therapy students in required clinical rotations, courses for this group only will begin on September 2, 2020.
Dalhousie University confers a Diploma in Health Science (for Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound, and Respiratory Therapy only) and a Bachelor of Health Science (Specific Discipline) degree. The active programs leading to these credentials are accredited. The University does not determine eligibility for certification/ registry exams. Rather, through accreditation, the University ensures that graduates of its programs meet the eligibility criteria set by the professional associations. Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound (General, Cardiac and Vascular), Nuclear Medicine, Radiological Technology, and Respiratory Therapy are accredited by Accreditation Canada.
For the professions of Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound, and Respiratory Therapy
Students are eligible to write the certification/registry exam upon successful completion of Year 3, when all requirements for a diploma exit have been met. They are eligible even if they choose not to exit with a diploma. Students should check with faculty concerning examination dates.
Following degree completion, students in Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound may be eligible to write certification/registry exams in the specialized areas of cardiac and vascular sonography.
For the professions of Nuclear Medicine Technology and Radiological Technology
Students are eligible to write the CAMRT certification exam upon successful completion of the Bachelor of Health Science degree.
The Professions
Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound
The Diagnostic Medical Sonographer utilizes high frequency sound waves, specialized equipment, and other diagnostic techniques to collect detailed information on the anatomical, physiological and pathological state of the patient. This health professional is able to produce and evaluate ultrasound images and related data that are used by specialized physicians to render a medical diagnosis. Sonographers typically provide technical expertise in abdomen, superficial structures, obstetrics/gynecology, vascular and cardiac applications.
Nuclear Medicine Technology
A nuclear medicine technologist is a health professional responsible for performing diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures. The technologist administers radiopharmaceuticals to the patient most often by way of an intravenous injection while adhering to proper drug preparation techniques, radiation protection guidelines and patient care practices.
The technologist operates a variety of radiation detection equipment, one of which is the gamma camera, in order to provide an assessment of the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical within the patient. By using various computer programs, the technologist analyzes the data to obtain the best information from the study which is then interpreted by a nuclear medicine physician.
Optimum operation of all equipment used in the practice of nuclear medicine is accomplished by the technologist, through the accurate implementation of a quality control program involving the assessment of radiation detection equipment, gamma cameras, and computers.
Radiological Technology
The radiological technologist is a health professional who utilizes radiation to produce images of patient’s anatomical structures. The quality of the image is critical as it will assist the physician in the diagnosis/treatment of the disease or injury.
 1475
 
The technologist must be knowledgeable and skilled in a wide variety of procedures as all body systems are imaged. Responsibilities include (but are not limited to) positioning the patient for radiologic procedures, care of the patient, appropriate choice and use of equipment, image manipulation, selection of radiation exposure factors, implementation of radiation protection techniques and critique of the radiograph. Whatever the procedure, the technologist must be adaptable to meet challenges presented by the patient’s physical or psychological state.
Respiratory Therapy
A respiratory therapist is a health professional who assists in the diagnosis, treatment and health promotion of patients with cardio-respiratory disorders through therapeutic means. Respiratory therapists provide cardio- pulmonary support, including cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation support, administration of medical gases, aerosolized medications, humidity therapy and airway management. The respiratory therapist also performs respiratory assessments of patients, tests and monitors cardio-pulmonary function, assists with the transport of high-risk patients and participates in home care programs.
The therapist plays an important role in the education of patients, families and hospital staff. The therapist is also involved in the maintenance, repair, testing and evaluation of respiratory equipment. The therapist must be able to provide competent assistance in cardio-pulmonary research.
Pre-Enrolment and Clinical Requirements
Immunization (current detailed version of policy can be found at www.dal.ca/health (current students, Policies and Procedures, clinical placement-immunization forms)
1. It is a regulation of the Faculty of Health and affiliated health care agencies that all students must be immunized. This has been instituted to protect patients as well as to protect students and employees.
2. Upon entering the program students must show certification for current immune status against tetanus, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, rubeola and varicella (chickenpox). Evidence of tuberculin testing (Mantoux – two step method) must also be shown. Annual Mantoux testing is also required. It is recommended that students be immunized for influenza on an annual basis.
3. The Hepatitis-B vaccination is required for all students. It is a series of three injections: the second and third shots are administered one month and six months after the first injection. The vaccination lasts for several years. This cost (approximately $105, subject to change) must be paid by the student.
Criminal Record Check
• All BHSc students must provide a criminal record check and a vulnerable sector survey (obtained within the previous six months) prior to attendance at any NSHA or IWK facility. An additional check may be required depending on clinical site requirements for subsequent placements.
BLS-HCP Certification
• All BHSc students must present proof of current certification in BLS at a Healthcare Provider level prior to entry into the program. Students are required to recertify on an annual basis.
First Aid Certification
• All BHSc students must show proof of current Standard First Aid certification prior to entry into the program. In order to be eligible for clinical practicum, Standard First Aid must not expire prior to July 15 of each academic year.
N95 Mask Fit Testing
  1476
 
• All BHSc students must be mask fit tested for a particulate respirator according to clinical site requirements. This must be recertified every two years, and may need to be recertified annually, depending on the mask in use at your clinical site.
Additional Costs
There are additional costs associated with all professional streams of the BHSc program, including but not limited to Standard First Aid and BLS-HCP certification, immunization, uniforms, membership in professional associations, equipment, fees for writing registry exams, N95 mask-fit testing, criminal record check, and travel to clinical
sites. These additional costs are the responsibility of the student. A detailed list is available from the School.
Intellectual, Emotional and Physical Demands
The health professions included in the Bachelor of Health Science program are intellectually, emotionally and physically demanding. It is important that students become familiar with the profession before entering the program so that they are able to function at an acceptable standard. It is common to have to lift and move heavy equipment, position patients, wear lead aprons, manipulate valves and knobs on equipment, remain on your feet for extended periods of time and move frequently from one clinical area to another. It is also common to have to view information displayed on computer monitors or on slides under a microscope. It might be necessary to distinguish fine gradations of color and to respond to alarms and buzzers. There may be emergency situations that arise in the health care setting that require students to respond immediately. Shift work may be required, including rotating 12-hour shifts. Latex gloves are in wide use and chemicals are used in a variety of settings. Refer to http://www.dal.cal/shs (Admissions) for Statements of Fitness required for each profession. Students who have concerns about fitness should contact the School for further information.
Program Outline
Four-Year Entry-Level Program
The curriculum is comprised of four years of full-time study with each year including core, interdisciplinary, discipline-specific, health professional and basic science courses.
Fourth-year BHSc students must meet the School’s clinical skills maintenance requirements and complete the “Record of Clinical Practice for Year 4” each term, until the 4th-year classwork is completed. Students should contact the School for full details.

Regulations
All students are required to observe the University Regulations and Academic Regulations as described in this calendar.
Academic
Workload
The normal workload is 30 credit hours per year during the regular academic session (September - April). In addition, an eight to 10 week clinical practicum worth three credit hours takes place in May - June following Years 1, 2, and 3 of the BHSc program:
   Fall Term
Winter Term
Spring Term (May-June)
15 credit hours 15 credit hours 3 credit hours
Normally, only a full-time course of studies (30 credit hours during the regular academic year and a three credit- hour practicum in the May-June time period) can be taken in the first three years of the four-year entry-level program. Interruption of studies will only be granted for leave of absence or voluntary withdrawal. The fourth year can be pursued on a part-time basis, subject to Academic Regulation 15.2, which regulates duration of undergraduate studies.
It is the responsibility of each individual student to ensure she/he is enrolled in the courses required to complete the BHSc program of study. Therefore students are expected to meet with their academic advisors to seek counselling in this regard, to ensure that course selections and course load are appropriate, and will not cause difficulties later on in the program.
 1485
 
The BHSc post-diploma program is available on a part time basis.
Permission to carry more than a normal workload
A workload exceeding these credit hours in any given term will be considered an Overload.
• Students who wish to take on an overload must have the approval from the School of Health Sciences Academic Regulations Officer. Any student applying for an increased workload (overload) must apply at least four weeks in advance of the start of the semester or year in question.
• In their request, students should include their reasons for seeking an overload and include supporting arguments and evidence, such as their academic record and any other relevant considerations.
• Applications from students who give good reasons for wishing to take an overload will be considered. Such permission will not normally be granted to any student in the first year of study, or to any student who, in the preceding academic term, obtained a grade point average of less than 3.00.
• During Clinical Practicum and/or Clinical Education Courses no additional courses will be permitted without prior approval from the Academic Regulations Officer.
• Such requests require student completion of a Waiver of Academic Regulation Application, available from your academic advisor, or the Registrar’s Office.
• Students who exceed the normal workload per academic term without the Academic Regulations Officer’s approval, will be required to withdraw from the course.
Attendance at Courses
Regular and punctual attendance at courses is required; students are expected to notify instructors if they are going to miss a course component. When the work of a student becomes unsatisfactory or attendance is irregular, the student may be required to withdraw from the school.
Grade Requirements
A student must receive a grade of C+ in each course with a course number in the School of Health Sciences (HSCE, DMUT, MDLT, MRIT, NUMT, RADT, RSPT) in order for that course:
• to be counted as a credit towards the Bachelor of Health Science or Diploma in Health Science
• to be considered as a prerequisite for another course
Since most professional courses are prerequisites for more advanced courses and for clinical practica, the student’s academic progress will be severely impacted by a failure. Students must seek academic advice.
Any student failing a required course for the second time must withdraw from the School of Health Sciences. Such a failure will be deemed an academic dismissal. See Regulation 20.2 for information on applying for readmission following an academic dismissal.
Students are reminded of Academic Regulations 18, 19.2 and 20.2 governing good standing, probation and academic dismissal.
Grade Point Average
A description of the grade point average (GPA) is found in Regulation 17.1.1 in the Dalhousie Undergraduate Calendar. The grade scale and definitions are found in Regulation 17.1.
Grading of Clinical Courses
Clinical education and specialty practice courses are graded on a letter grade basis.
Students who have been removed from any course due to unsafe or unsatisfactory clinical performance will receive a failing (F) grade.
  1486
 
Supplemental Exams
In courses with a course number in the School of Health Sciences, supplemental privileges may be granted only at the discretion of the course professor to a student with a final grade of FM (Regulation 16.5, Dalhousie Undergraduate Calendar). Each course outline will state the conditions that must be met in order to be eligible. The supplemental may be practical, written or combined practical/written exam at the discretion of the professor. Students who receive a grade of F are ineligible for supplemental privileges and will be required to repeat the course.
The date and time of the supplemental exam will be negotiated between the student and course professor within the following guidelines: For Fall Term courses, the supplemental exam must be completed before the end of the first week of classes of the Winter Term. For Winter Term courses, the supplemental exam must be passed before the student can begin their clinical placement. In no case will a clinical placement be delayed for more than two weeks.
No more than two supplemental exams for courses with course numbers in the School of Health Sciences will be allowed in one year. Only one supplemental exam is allowed per course.
Voluntary Withdrawal
Students who voluntarily withdraw from the School of Health Sciences, having satisfactorily completed courses toward the BHSc (specific discipline) degree, with the intention of returning at a later date are advised that re- acceptance is contingent upon there being an available place.
Leave of Absence
1. Students who apply for a leave of absence (LOA) from their program of study must do so in writing to the School of Health Sciences Academic Regulations Officer. If possible, such applications should be made in advance of the term or year for which a LOA is being requested.
2. A request for Leave of Absence may be for a duration of one term to a maximum of one year in length. Students are eligible for a maximum of one such leave for the duration of their program.
3. Following approval of the application for LOA, the Academic Regulations Officer will notify the following individuals:
a) The student;
b) Dalhousie University Registrar’s Office;
c) Students Services office at the School; and d) Student’s academic advisor
4. Students may apply to return to the program prior to the designated end of the LOA. At the time students return to the program, the LOA is considered ended.
5. At least two to three months prior to returning to the program, students granted LOA will inform the following, in writing, of their intent to resume their studies:
a) Academic Regulations Officer; and
b) Student’s academic advisor
Students should also initiate discussion with his/her academic advisor to discuss plans for resumption
of courses and required remedial action plan.
6. The Academic Regulations Officer will notify the Dalhousie Registrar’s Office and the Student Services
office at the School of the student’s planned return date to the program.
7. It is important to note that for the duration of a leave of absence, the clock stops on the six year rule
for discipline-specific courses, and the 10 year rule for all other courses.
8. No academic credit will be granted towards BHSc course requirements for work completed at another
institution during a LOA.
9. If a leave of absence is granted, students must ensure they formally withdraw from courses in
accordance with Dalhousie University regulations.
 1487
 
10. Students on approved leave of absence will be considered in abeyance from regular academic programming, and therefore not a student at Dalhousie University, until such time that they reactivate their student status through the Registrar's Office.
Policy on Students at Risk
The School of Health Sciences is committed to providing students every opportunity for success in their program. Although the responsibility lies with the student, processes are in place at the School to identify, and assist students at academic risk.
The School of Health Sciences Students at Risk Policy aims to identify students at risk and recommend a course of academic and/or clinical remediation to ensure students are provided the opportunity to achieve academic and clinical success.
Re-Admission of Academically Dismissed Students Policy
The primary goal of the School of Health Sciences and Dalhousie University is to ensure students are successful in their chosen profession while maintaining integrity of the program. Academic Regulation Section 20.1.3 allows for students who have been academically dismissed to apply for readmission to the University. Decisions on readmission to a program in the School of Health Sciences are made in consultation with the individual stream, clinical coordinator, and the Admissions Committee and will include, but not be limited to, consideration of availability of clinical placements.
Appeal
Students who wish to appeal a decision based on school or university regulations should consult the Program Officer or their Advisor concerning the correct procedure. Contact the School main office for complete terms of reference for the Faculty of Health Student Appeals Committee and the application regarding academic appeals.
Clinical Education Components of Health Sciences
Health Sciences education encompasses a broad spectrum of learning experiences that together prepare caring, competent and ethical practitioners able to function in a rapidly changing health care environment. The BHSc program is delivered through an integrated curriculum and students receive clinical education logically sequenced within core, interdisciplinary, discipline-specific, and clinical education courses and clinical practica. Clinical education components enable students to integrate theory with practice, master clinical competencies, develop critical reasoning skills and demonstrate professional behavior in a variety of settings with a diversity of patients.
Successful completion of all clinical components of the program is mandatory. Clinical practica and clinical education courses are required courses in the program of study and it is not possible to exercise the diploma exit option or to receive a BHSc degree without successfully completing these courses. In addition, each of the clinical experiences is a prerequisite for further progress in the program. Course outlines provide specific information about criteria for successful completion and opportunities for remediation.
In preparation for clinical practicum, all students must participate in a workshop dedicated to professional behavior. The specific date is available from the School of Health Sciences.
Three elements of clinical education are:
Clinical Practicum
The program includes three clinical practica scheduled during the May - June time period following Years 1, 2, and 3. The Clinical Practicum is designed to provide students with opportunities to develop the knowledge, skills and professional attitudes necessary to function as competent entry-level practitioners within a variety of settings and with a broad range of patients. Students are assigned to various clinical sites, based on their level within the program, the expected learning outcomes of their professional stream, and the availability of appropriate sites.
Clinical placements will be arranged by the Clinical Coordinator for the School of Health Sciences. Students may be assigned to clinical sites located within the Halifax region, throughout the Atlantic provinces, and in various sites
  1488
 
across Canada. All expenses related to clinical placement are the responsibility of the student. Students are scheduled in a clinical setting for eight-to-ten consecutive weeks, and are supervised by preceptors. The normal student/preceptor ratio is one-to-one. Evaluation may include, but is not limited to, assessment of skills competencies, demonstration of professional behaviors, and application of theory to practice. Students monitor their personal and professional growth through introspection and reflection by maintaining journals, recording experiences in skills log books, successfully passing examinations or presenting case studies.
Clinical Education Courses
These courses provide students with an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a specific area of clinical practice. Scheduling requires full-time rotations in the clinical setting and, depending on the area, may require shift work and/or off-site rotation. Students may be required to travel to a site outside Halifax in order to meet their clinical learning objectives. Preceptors supervise and guide students through this period of study and skills practice. Faculty continue to support students by facilitating seminars/tutorials, conducting assessments, providing constructive feedback and structuring learning experiences to further develop critical reasoning skills. Medical specialists and practitioners may be invited to share their expertise with students. There may be interprofessional learning experiences designed to enhance students’ understanding of the team approach to health care. Evaluation methods may include, but are not limited to, a written examination to assess knowledge of subject matter, and practical assessments to confirm that clinical skills and professional behavior are readily applied at the expected level of performance. Clinical Education Courses are taken in Year 3 at all programs. In addition, Clinical Education Courses are a required part of the Year 4 curriculum for students in Nuclear Medicine Technology and Radiological Technology.
Specialty Practice Courses
Specialty practice affords students the opportunity to attain additional competence and knowledge in a specialty practice area. There are three components to specialty practice: clinical, contextual and theoretical. This course can be six or twelve credit hours depending on the nature of the specialty practice. Specialty practice is arranged through consultation with the discipline specific program/post diploma advisor.
Interprofessional Health Education
Students are required to maintain enrolment in IPHE 4900 (see calendar section on Health Professions, Interprofessional Health Education) for the duration of their studies. Please register in IPHE 4900.00 section

Preceptors
Many nurses and persons in other disciplines, and settings, provide valuable assistance in the education of nursing students. Names can be obtained by contacting the School of Nursing.
School of Nursing Regulations
1. Students are required to observe the University Regulations and Academic Regulations as described in this calendar.
2. Students are assessed in each year on their aptitude and fitness for nursing. Students who, in the judgment of the faculty, fail to attain a satisfactory standard in this assessment may be required to withdraw from the School.
3. Students are responsible for ensuring that they are registered in appropriate courses throughout the program. Incorrect registration, at any time, could cause conflicts in a student’s year-to-year progression and/or graduation.
4. Students in the Baccalaureate Program are responsible for (a) the purchase of uniforms including shoes and a watch with a sweep hand or a digital watch with seconds display, (b) cost of accommodation and travel while on clinical experiences. Additional expenses are incurred by students in the Basic Baccalaureate Program for field experience, books, first aid course, CPR course, graduation pin,
 1527
 
equipment, and nurse registration examinations and recommended and/or required immunizations
and/or testing. Each student must also purchase a name tag from the University.
5. Because of enrolment limits on class size, part-time students who wish to change to full-time status
must present this request in writing to the Assistant Director, Undergraduate Studies by March 1.
6. Students are assigned to a faculty member from the Undergraduate Student Affairs Committee to help
them plan their academic program and to discuss academic progress or difficulties.
7. Students are permitted to repeat any course (non-nursing, core nursing courses including clinical
practice and electives) in the BScN program only once. A second failure in any course (whether the second failure occurs in a previously failed course, or in a course taken for the first time in the program) will result in dismissal from the program for 1 year. Students are permitted to reapply to the program. Readmission to the program is not guaranteed and the applicant must demonstrate their preparation to return to studies.
8. Students wishing to appeal a decision based on faculty regulations or decisions should follow the School of Nursing Appeal Procedure outlined in the Nursing Student Guide.
9. Supplemental exams will not be available in any nursing courses.
10. Because of the nature of the study and practice of Nursing which places Nursing students in a position
of special trust, applicants will be asked to complete a screening question related to past criminal convictions which might affect the applicant’s suitability for the practice of nursing. Students accepted into the nursing program who provide false information will be disciplined by the university. It is the student’s responsibility to inform the Assistant Director (Undergraduate Studies) of any new criminal conviction which could affect the student’s suitability for practice.
11. Once enrolled in the Nursing Program it is the students’ continuing responsibility to inform the Assistant Director Undergraduate Studies of any criminal conviction or any significant personal circumstance which would adversely affect their ability to continue with their studies or which would make them ineligible for registration within CRNNS upon graduation.
12. Progression in the program requires a C (minimum 60%) in each non-nursing course and C+ (minimum 65%) or Pass (P) in each nursing course. Progression in the program requires a GPA of 2.30 or greater (semester to semester) for all years of the program. F and INC are failing grades. ILL and W are considered neutral.
School of Nursing Appeal Procedure
The University has established a system which allows students to appeal academic decisions made by faculty. Appeals can be heard at different levels within the University: At the School and at Senate. Appeals are heard in the School by the Student Appeals Committee and at Senate level by the Senate Academic Appeals Committee.

 Introduction
The Atlantic School of Occupational Therapy was established in 1982 as the only occupational therapy education program in Atlantic Canada. The School exists in response to strong regional advocacy, particularly since 1958 when a School was approved in principle by the University Senate. The regional orientation of the School fosters collaborative teaching, research and professional activities linking those at the university with occupational therapy and other service providers, government workers, and citizens in the four Atlantic Provinces. This regional mandate is combined with an international perspective linking Dalhousie with universities and communities for fieldwork and research.
Occupational Therapy is a health profession concerned with social inclusion. Practitioners enhance the occupational performance engagement, health and well-being of individuals, groups, and organizations, particularly where inequities or injustice limit opportunities for meaningful participation in daily life occupations.
Occupation is viewed broadly to include everything we do to “occupy” ourselves in enjoying life, looking after ourselves and others, and contributing to the social and economic productivity of our communities.
Health is viewed broadly as having the ability, opportunity and resources, for quality of life with meaningful occupations in supportive environments.
Occupational therapists use their understanding of occupation, enabling processes, justice and systems to enable individuals, groups and organizations to overcome obstacles that limit their ability to do things they need and want to do. Obstacles addressed by occupational therapists may include illness, injury, physical or mental disability, developmental delay, social disadvantage, old age, cultural, and physical barriers in the home, community and workplace. Using a “partnership” approach, occupational therapists work with individual families, groups, communities, organizations, populations, businesses or governments. The focus can be either on enabling individual change, or enabling change in physical and social environments, policies or legislature to enhance occupational performance and engagement in society. Practice may enable change in skills, attitudes, routines, design of buildings, use of assistive technology, policies, etc.
The role of an occupational therapist is varied and challenging. Occupational issues are never the same because no two people or environments are ever exactly the same. The challenge for occupational therapists is to plan and implement the “just right” program or strategy for each and every client so that everyone can achieve just opportunities to participate in society.
Degrees Offered
In concert with national standards and requirements for occupational therapy education, the School of Occupational Therapy at Dalhousie University only offers graduate level degree programs. For further information on our occupational therapy degree programs, please refer to the Graduate Calendar.
Certificate in Disability Management
The School of Occupational Therapy offers a Certificate Program in Disability Management to students currently enrolled in an academic program at Dalhousie or another Canadian university.

Course Descriptions
OCCU 2000 Occupation and Daily Life
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This introductory course for students in arts, social sciences, science and other fields is designed to explore the meaning of occupation in everyday life. Typically, the term “occupation” refers to categories of paid work. This course will explore a broader meaning of occupation; namely purposeful activity. This concept of occupation will include everything we do to look after and develop ourselves, be involved in meaningful endeavours, contribute to our communities, promote health, advocate for opportunities, generate income and more. Students will be exposed to a broad range of literature on occupation; the motivation, organization and performance of occupation; the environment as a context for occupational performance; and the promotion of health through occupation. Students will gain an appreciation of occupation as the foundation of everyday life through sociological, anthropological and narrative analysis, and experiential activities.

History
Formal pharmacy education in the Maritime provinces began in 1908, with evening classes in pharmacy and chemistry conducted in the Nova Scotia Technical College. Success of these courses encouraged the Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society to establish the Nova Scotia College of Pharmacy in 1911. The College was affiliated with Dalhousie University in 1912.
The New Brunswick Pharmaceutical Society and the Prince Edward Island Pharmaceutical Association were admitted to affiliation with the College in 1917 and 1950, respectively. With the affiliation of the former society, the College was renamed the Maritime College of Pharmacy.
In 1961, the Maritime College of Pharmacy was admitted into Dalhousie University as the College of Pharmacy, a constituent part of the new Faculty of Health Professions. A four-year baccalaureate program was introduced.
In 1966, a Master’s program was established, followed by a Doctor of Philosophy program in 1977.
In 1972, a twelve month pharmacy residency program was initiated by Camp Hill Hospital in cooperation with the College of Pharmacy. Programs were initiated at the Halifax Infirmary in 1974, at the Victoria General Hospital in 1981 and at the Saint John Regional Hospital in 1982.
In the fall of 1968, the College of Pharmacy moved into the George A. Burbidge Pharmacy Building. This building, the former Medical Sciences Building was renamed in honour of the first Dean of the College, in recognition of his contribution to pharmacy education in the Maritimes. Present facilities accommodate approximately 360 undergraduate students.

College of Pharmacy Regulations
All students are required to observe the University Regulations and Academic Regulations as described in this Calendar. The academic performance of each student in the College is assessed by the Student Promotions Committee.
Academic Requirements
Workload
The curriculum is composed of problem-based learning (PBL) and other courses, which may include tutorials, lectures, labs, practice experience and other components. (See IV. Programs offered). To satisfy the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy, a student must achieve a grade of Pass in each prescribed component. PBL courses vary in length from three to seven weeks, and are weighted as either 1.5, 3, or 6 credit hours. Each academic year totals 27, 31.5, or 33 credit hours, with the program total being 123 credit hours.
Students are required to successfully complete all practice experience rotations. These placements may be outside the Halifax/Dartmouth area. Students are responsible for any travel, accommodation and any other costs associated with practice experience rotations.
Academic Recognition
Awards
The College of Pharmacy Awards Committee administers a number of awards, each with defined criteria. Selection of award recipients described as the “student who excels” is based on a combination of performance in knowledge assessments and in tutorials. Eligibility for In-course Scholarships is determined on the basis of knowledge assessments alone.
Dean’s List
Students will be assessed for Dean’s List based on their knowledge assessments and class standing in the annual “Progress Exam.” No student who has obtained a failing grade (FM or F) will be eligible for the Dean’s List in the year in question.
Distinction
Students who have been on the Dean’s List for three of the four years of the Pharmacy Program and a cumulative GPA of 3.70 or higher will graduate with Distinction.
Assessment
1. Grading is on a Pass/Fail basis, and grades recorded on the official University transcript are “Pass”, "Marginal Fail" or “Fail” (P, FM, F). Students must pass all components of the year in which they are registered to proceed to the next year. The passing grade for knowledge assessments is 60% unless otherwise indicated.
2. Student performance will be assessed during and at the end of each PBL course. Assessment will be of both the learning process and the knowledge/skills achieved. Tutors will provide informal assessment of the student’s learning process throughout a PBL course and a formal assessment (student tutorial performance assessment) at the completion of a course. Knowledge/skills will be assessed as described in the syllabus provided for each course.
3. To pass a PBL course, a student must pass both the student tutorial performance assessment and the course knowledge assessment.
4. A student who fails no more than one academic course will be assigned a grade of marginal failure (FM) in that course. The student must meet with the Associate Director, Student Affairs to discuss
 1551
 
remediation and/or support. More than one failure will result in all failed course being assigned the
grade of Fail (F).
5. The Student Promotions Committee of the College of Pharmacy is responsible for monitoring the
academic progress of students and providing recommendations to faculty regarding promotion and graduation of students. Students who seek redress for the application of the regulations of the College of Pharmacy should refer to the appeals process described in Appeals section below.
6. Attendance at the tutorials, skills laboratory and practice experience program (PEP) is mandatory. Absence must be supported with a valid reason, such as illness with a medical certificate or other reason approved by the Undergraduate Education Committee. Other absences will be reported to the Student Promotions Committee and may be reason for failure.
Reassessment of a Grade
See Academic Regulation 16.7. In all cases of reassessment, the calculations used to arrive at the final grade will be checked. In those courses where the student has had ample time to consider marks obtained for all work done, except for the final examination, reassessment in such courses shall be done on the final examination only. For other courses, a reassessment shall include the results from all work not previously available to the student during the term.
Supplemental Assessment
1. A student who receives a grade of FM is eligible for remedial work and supplemental assessment.
2. A student who fails one PBL student tutorial performance assessment must undertake remedial work
during the following course, organized by the Associate Director, Student Affairs. If the failure occurs in the final course of the year, remediation will occur during the summer. The student must successfully complete the remedial work and supplemental assessment to achieve a Pass.
3. A student who fails the knowledge assessment or other requirement outlined in the syllabus of a PBL or non-PBL course will be required to do remedial work and must pass a supplemental assessment, which will be scheduled by the course coordinator in consultation with the Associate Director, Student Affairs and the students involved.
4. If a student fails one PBL or non-PBL course, the grade will be recorded as "FM" on the student's transcript. Failure to pass the remedial work and supplemental assessment will lead to conversion of the grade to "F". If the student successfully completes the remedial work and supplemental assessment, the passing grade will then be added to the transcript and recorded as “P” with a notation that the grade was earned by supplemental assessment.
5. Failure in a second course (either a PBL or non-PBL course) will negate a pass that may have been achieved by supplemental assessment in the first failed course. (See F.1.a below.)
Repeating the Year
1. Subject to eligibility, a student will be required to repeat the year if:
a) the student has failed any two courses (PBL or non-PBL courses) or
b) the student has failed one course and has not successfully completed the prescribed remedial work and supplemental assessment.
1. To be eligible to repeat a year, a student who has failed two courses must satisfactorily complete all other year requirements except the Practice Experience Program. However, a student with two failures will not be eligible to register in the Practice Experience Program.
2. Application to repeat the year must be made in writing to the Associate Director, Student Affairs by a predetermined date.
  1552

3. Any student who withdraws voluntarily, due to illness or other personal circumstances, and is allowed to repeat the year, will be considered a student in a repeat year unless the student withdraws before the last day of the first PBL course of the academic year, or the student tutorial performance assessment, if the two do not coincide.
4. No student will be allowed more than one repeat year during the undergraduate program. All students who repeat the year will be assessed on performance in the repeated year.
Leave of Absence
A student who needs to take leave from the pharmacy program must apply to the Director to do so. A leave of absence must be approved in advance by the Director of the College of Pharmacy. Normally, a student who absents himself/herself from the College of Pharmacy without prior permission for an extended period (four weeks or greater) will be presumed to have withdrawn and will have to re-apply for admission to the College of Pharmacy. A leave of absence will be limited to one leave period and will not normally exceed one academic year. A leave of absence will not count towards time in the Pharmacy program.
Dismissal from the Study of Pharmacy
1. Any student who fails more than two courses (PBL or non-PBL courses) of the curriculum in one year will be dismissed from the study of pharmacy.
2. A student in a repeat year who does not meet the criteria for promotion will be dismissed. The normal regulation allowing remedial work and supplemental assessment in one course will apply.
3. Students are also referred to University Regulations: Suspension or Dismissal from a Program on the Grounds of Professional Unsuitability - Faculty of Health Professions.
Appeals
Students who wish to raise questions or to register complaints in matters of academic appeal are advised to communicate informally with their instructor within 10 working days of the alleged unfairness or irregularity. If no resolution arises from this (these) meeting(s), the student may initiate a formal appeal.
Students wishing to initiate a formal appeal should follow the appeals procedures as set out by the College of Pharmacy, Undergraduate Student Appeals Committee, Faculty of Health Professions. These procedures are available online, Faculty of Health Professions website, "For current students", Student Policies and Procedures. Application for a formal appeal should be made to the College of Pharmacy Chair, Undergraduate Student Appeals Committee within 20 working days of the matter giving rise to the appeal.
Programs Offered
The College of Pharmacy offers a four-year program, following at least one year of general science, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science (Pharmacy) - BSc (Pharm).
The undergraduate program has a patient-oriented curriculum integrating clinical pharmacy with the pharmaceutical sciences. The curriculum utilizes an integrated problem-based learning (PBL) format.
Year 1 includes pharmacy law and health care ethics, biomedical and physical sciences (anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology and physiology) in discrete three-to seven-week courses. The pharmaceutical sciences (biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics, medicinal chemistry, drug metabolism, toxicology, pharmaceutics and physical pharmacy) with necessary reviews of biomedical content, are integrated in Years 2 through 4, with therapeutics, pharmacoepidemiology, pharmacoeconomics, pharmaceutical care, communications, interprofessional relations, law and ethics, social and administrative pharmacy issues, and the role of pharmacy in the health care system.
 1553
 
The College participates with the Nova Scotia Health Authority (Central Zone), Halifax, NS; the Horizon Health Network, Saint John and Moncton, NB; and the IWK Health Centre, Halifax, NS (Accreditation Pending) in providing a Canadian Pharmacy Residency Board (CPRB) accredited twelve-month post graduate hospital pharmacy residency program.
Through structured rotations in various areas of pharmacy practice, the program aims to prepare pharmacists for exemplary pharmacy practice. Areas of rotation include patient care, drug information, drug distribution, pharmacy administration, a research project and in-service and education. The emphasis is on providing exemplary patient care. Practitioner role models/preceptors are utilized throughout the program to mentor the necessary skills, knowledge and values required to be a pharmacist for application by the resident. A stipend is provided and a certificate is presented to candidates successfully completing the program.
Undergraduate Curriculum Structure
The PBL curriculum, within the College of Pharmacy, may be scheduled past the posted exam periods. Students are responsible for all costs associated with expenses during this time (e.g. meal plan expiration, residence closure, etc.).
Problem-Based Learning (PBL) Courses
A minimal number of classes explain difficult concepts and summarize case material.
Tutorials
The principal feature of the curriculum is PBL. Students learn together in tutorial groups of eight to ten.
Each group is facilitated by a trained non (content)-expert tutor who may be faculty, sessional tutors, practitioners or graduate students.
Two-hour tutorials are held three times a week. In tutorial sessions students are presented with a situation for which they must identify their own prior knowledge and set specific learning objectives. Students use the time between tutorial sessions for self-directed learning of the objectives that they have set. Subsequent tutorials consist of discussion and application of knowledge.
Non-PBL Courses
There are some courses in each year that may be lecture based, assignment based, or case based.
Skills Laboratory
The skills laboratory focuses on practical skill development and application of knowledge acquired in the PBL curriculum and critical appraisal series. Activities required for successful completion of the practical experience program are introduced and practiced. Content includes but is not limited to: extemporaneous compounding, prescription filling and assessment, written and verbal communication skills, patient education, device training, injection training, and jurisprudence.
A cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) level HCP and standard first aid course are the students’ responsibility in cost.
Practice Experience Program (PEP)
A progressive professional field experience complements the PBL curriculum as follows:
Year 1 - Community Experience Program (CEP)
• the equivalent of a half day per week in a goal-related service learning in a non-pharmacy health- oriented community site.
Year 2 - Practice Experience Program (PEP)
 1554
 
• PHAR 2081.03: Practice Experience Program - Hospital Rotation (two consecutive weeks)
• PHAR 2082.03: Practice Experience Program (PEP) II - Community Rotation (two consecutive weeks)
Second year rotations are completed during the months of May - August, after successful completion of all other second year courses. Each rotation is two weeks in length, at a minimum of 35 hours/week. Second year rotations provide students with an opportunity to see pharmacists practice patient focused care in both community and hospital practice settings. Time is also spent on the distributive, legislative and administrative components of pharmacy practice.
Year 3 - Practice Experience Program (PEP)
• PHAR 3080.03: Practice Experience Program (PEP) III - Community Rotation (four consecutive weeks)
This rotation is completed during the months of May - August, after successful completion of all other third year courses. This rotation is four weeks in length at a minimum of 35 hours/week and introduces students to the practical application of the pharmacist’s patient care process in a community pharmacy. Rotation objectives address drug information, prescription and non-prescription medications, patient education, and health promotion presentations to community groups. This rotation is intended to provide an introductory experience to clinical activities including: monitoring patients, identifying drug-related problems, and defining and measuring patient goals and outcomes.
Year 4 - Practice Experience Program (PEP)
• PHAR 4080.045: Practice Experience Program (PEP) IV – Hospital Rotation (six consecutive weeks)
• PHAR 4085.045: Practice Experience Program (PEP) V – Community Rotation (six consecutive weeks)
These six-week rotations are the culmination of the student’s study. Experiential rotations in hospital and community practice sites allow students the opportunity to apply all the knowledge, skills and values they have developed to the provision of total pharmacy care. The focus of these rotations is patient-based and primarily clinical. Each rotation is six-weeks, at a minimum of 40 hours/week.
For each rotation, from year 2 through to year 4, students are required to travel to sites outside of the Halifax area and will be responsible for any costs incurred as a result of the program.
Students should note that there are very limited PEP rotation sites outside the Maritime Provinces. All PEP rotations must take place within Canada. Students must be prepared to complete all PEP rotations within the Maritimes.

Failure to provide this information may result in a student being denied access to a placement site.
Career Opportunities
Pharmacy is a health profession in which pharmacists provide care for their patients as one member of the health care team. This care focuses on the patient from the perspective of drug therapy. The pharmacist is responsible to identify, prevent and resolve patient drug therapy problems. Specific activities include: taking medication histories, identifying goals for drug therapy, providing recommendations and education to patients regarding self- medication, providing recommendations to other health care providers on drug therapy, working with patients to maximize benefits and minimize adverse effects of drug therapy, maintaining patient drug profiles, counseling patients on prescribed medication, monitoring drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and patient compliance with their drug treatment. Other activities include the provision of information on drugs to patients and other health professionals, the preparation of suitable materials for use as medicines from natural and synthetic sources, the compounding of drugs and the dispensing of suitable medication.
Pharmacy graduates have a wide range of career opportunities. The majority enter community pharmacy practice. Hospital pharmacy also provides an interesting challenge for pharmacists, particularly in view of their expanding role within the clinical setting. The pharmaceutical industry provides opportunities for pharmacists in the fields of sales and marketing, production, research and quality control.
The increased role of federal and provincial governments in public health provides opportunities for pharmacists in analytical laboratories and in administrative position as consultants, government inspectors and health officers. Opportunities may also be available in universities as teachers and researchers.
A Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy is necessary for those who wish to practice as licensed pharmacists. For those who wish to enter research or teaching, a Master of Science degree or further postgraduate study is usually required.
Practice Requirements
1. License in Pharmacy
The College of Pharmacy, being purely educational, has no jurisdiction in matters related to licensing or to registration as a Pharmacist. These functions are entirely under the control of the provincial regulatory authority concerned; a period of practical training or apprenticeship is required by the provincial regulatory authority before a graduate in pharmacy is licensed as a pharmacist. Information regarding licensing or registration in each province may be obtained from the respective provincial regulatory authority: New Brunswick College of
Pharmacists; Prince Edward Island College of Pharmacists; Nova Scotia College of Pharmacists.
2. Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada (PEBC)
The Pharmacy Examining board of Canada was created by Federal Statute on December 21, 1963, to establish qualifications for pharmacists acceptable to participating pharmacy provincial regulatory authorities. The Board provides for annual examinations and issues a certificate to the successful candidate, which may be filed with a Canadian provincial regulatory authority in connection with an application for license to practice pharmacy under
 1557
 
the laws of that province. Baccalaureate graduates from Faculties of Pharmacy accredited by the Canadian Council for Accreditation of Pharmacy Programs are eligible to write these examinations. Successful completion of these examinations is a prerequisite to licensure in Canada.
Individuals who are not graduates of an accredited Canadian Faculty of Pharmacy must first complete the PEBC Qualifying Exam.
Student Pharmacy Society
The basic aims of the Student Pharmacy Society are to promote a closer liaison with the other societies on campus, to give the pharmacy students a strong position with regard to Student Council activities, to provide a means of communications between students and their respective provincial regulatory authorities in the Maritimes, and to provide an organizational body which plans and finances the various unique Pharmacy Society activities.
Membership in the Pharmacy Society includes membership in the Canadian Association of Pharmacy Students and Interns and membership in the Canadian Pharmacists Association.

 Introduction
The School of Social Work's vision is a commitment to building a socially just society, defined as one that upholds and validates the values of equality, diversity, inclusiveness, democracy and concern for human welfare. We manifest and advance curricula, scholarship and school culture that are congruent with those values.
The BSW degree program is accredited by the Canadian Association for Social Work Education. It embraces a critical and anti-oppressive approach to social work practice that includes an emphasis on social policy, research skills and critical analysis, professional values, theoretical perspectives and practice methods. While the program has evolved within the context of the people, communities and service network of the Maritime Provinces, graduates are qualified to practice social work throughout Canada and beyond.
BSW Delivery Options
The BSW is a 120 credit hour degree program and is offered on campus and by distance delivery online. Both delivery methods include a 700 hour community based field placement experience. The application deadline is February 15th of each year.
Continuing Education
The School offers a Continuing Education Program (non-credit) of thematic workshops.
Nova Scotia College of Social Workers
Provincial legislation requires that only persons who are licensed with the Nova Scotia College of Social Workers (NSCSW) can practice as social workers within Nova Scotia. To become fully licensed and use the title of Social Worker after award of the BSW degree, at least 3,858 hours of paid supervised social work experience is necessary.

This is an introductory course on trauma informed practice in social work which focuses on understanding trauma, coping with trauma, trauma informed care and practice in generalist and community based social work settings. The course will explore how trauma impacts people and communities on personal, interpersonal and societal levels across generations with an emphasis on children/youth, Indigenous peoples, women and other marginalized populations. It will examine the interconnections of social work values with trauma informed practice and explore ways for social work to avoid retraumatizing and revictimizing those we work with. This course will also explore the knowledge and skills needed to help mitigate the impact of working in trauma exposed social work environments. The first class will discuss how course material can be difficult and the importance of addressing trauma as a central aspect of social work practice.

A work term is a period of time when a student gains practical experience in a business-related work environment. Each passed work term is an academic half credit and must meet the requirements listed below. Three passed work terms are required to graduate.
During a work term a student is considered an employee of their work term employer with reference to the conditions of their employment, and is a student with respect to academic evaluation only. The university does not accept liability for the student's work environment.
Students are remunerated according to employer policy and the labour laws of the jurisdiction in which they work.
Members of the Management Career Services team conduct mid-term reviews with both the employers and students to ensure the work term objectives are being met.
Work Term Requirements
Students receive academic credit upon completion of the following for each work term:
1. Students must register for each work term (COMM 2801, COMM 3801 and COMM 3802) via Dal Online.
2. Students must complete all mandatory requirements for co-op orientation.
3. Each work term must be completed within the designated semester with one employer. A work term
must total no less than 12 weeks, and must be a minimum of 35 hours per week.
4. All jobs, including self-developed jobs, must be approved by Management Career Services (MCS).
5. Students are responsible for finding suitable employment. Students complete a Co-op Education
Program Agreement prior to the first work term accepting this responsibility. Support for the job
search is provided by MCS, and job opportunities are posted on the myCareer job posting system.

These fees are non-refundable after the deadline dates listed in the University Calendar. Students who transfer into the program from another department, or another institution, are responsible for back payments.
Students completing an academic term (three or more half credit courses) outside of Dalhousie on a Letter of Permission are also responsible for the payment of co-op fees. Before the Letter of Permission can be granted, students must sign a co-op fee agreement, available from the Undergraduate Advising Office.
Payment of all fees is required to obtain a Bachelor of Commerce (Co-op) Degree. Consult the Fees section of the Dalhousie University Calendar for details.

Specific topics, examined from the family business perspective, include: the decision to join a family firm, management succession, ownership succession, the role of key non-family employees, strategic planning and other issues especially relevant for family firms. The course also addresses conflict and

communication in the family and the business. The course has two purposes. First, it provides an organized framework for students to understand the dynamics and special issues of family firms. Second, it is designed to allow students to explore their interest in joining a family firm. Therefore, it is especially intended for students who come from families which are in business or for students considering joining a family business. Others who wish to explore a key segment of Canadian business are also welcome. The course relies on field projects, guest speakers, case studies, videos, research papers and extensive class discussion to explore the territory of managing family businesses.

The course seeks to prepare students to face those challenges. It is ideal for students who wish to work in a service industry (e.g., banking, insurance, travel, hospitality, consulting) or in a service capacity in the manufacturing sector (e.g., sales, customer relations). Emphasis will be placed on understanding the distinctive characteristics of services, the implications of these distinctions for marketing, the role of service quality as a determinant of customer satisfaction, and the measurement of these phenomena. Examples will be drawn from North American and European service industries.

COMM 4701 International Business Strategy
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The objective of this course is to help the students understand why firms expand overseas and how foreign operations differ from domestic ones. It provides the students with the necessary knowledge for a career or further study in international business. The course introduces the basic concepts of international business from a manager's perspective. It examines the issues and problems that arise when business operations extend across national boundaries and become international in scope or character. The emphasis is two-fold. First, consideration is given to the characteristics and contemporary dynamics of the world economy. Second, analysis is made of the development of the multinational firm and of the adaptation of the basic managerial functions due to internationalization. The course orientation is pragmatic and managerial. Through case studies, class discussions, assigned readings, and lectures, the students are expected to develop the skills for analyzing situations and formulating solutions in an international business context.

while others choose to tailor carefully their multinational operations to the legitimate economics, political and social aspirations of diverse national governments. Yet others seek to balance conflicting demands through intensive organization wide coordination and shared decision making. This course examines critically the generic and functional strategies open to multinational enterprises and through numerous industry and business case studies. Classes comprise case analyses, lectures, as well as independent research, class presentations and guest speakers. As the success depends in large measure on the preparedness and effective participation of course members, attendance is crucial and particular attention is paid to the quality of individual contributions to case discussion.

CREDIT HOURS: 3
Ecological economics is an emergent, transdisciplinary field of inquiry whose primary concern is to advance the body of theory and tools to understand and manage the environmental dimensions of economic activity. It is an explicitly normative field oriented towards environmental sustainability in economic organization. Ecological economics recognizes three conditions necessary to environmental sustainability: appropriate scale (relative to biocapacity), efficient allocation, and just distribution. Given the breadth of material encompassed within the scope of ecological economics, this class will explore a subset of possible topics including the basic principles and theory of scale, efficiency, and distributive justice. In addition, the class will look at how these apply to managing real world issues in environmental management and explore the tools used by ecological economists to quantify and interpret scale, efficiency, and distributive justice. This course is designed as a one-term introduction to ecological economics for graduate students in environmental studies and related programs with little or no prior exposure to economics.

The reputation of audit and consulting companies associated with these ill-fated corporations suffered a great setback, leaving stakeholders wondering whom to trust to safeguard their interests.Students will take an in-depth look at the corporate governance triad, as indicated above, that controls the modern corporation. Accordingly, this course will deal with the control, composition, functions, roles, and structure of boards; board responsibility and accountability, CEO tenure and compensation, shareholder and other stakeholder representation; corporate board’s vis-à-vis social responsibility and ethics; and comparative corporate governance across North America, Europe, and selected Asian countries.

Introduction
Dalhousie’s Norman Newman Centre for Entrepreneurship, in collaboration with the Centre for Entrepreneurship Education and Development (CEED), offers a Certificate Program in entrepreneurship – the Entrepreneurial Skills Program (ESP), which is open to all Dalhousie University students.
ESP facilitates the development, growth and success of student-run ventures. Through extracurricular, individualized, experiential learning, you will apply skills learned in the classroom to your own ventures. Students participating in the program develop personal portfolios that illustrate their entrepreneurial capabilities. At Dalhousie there is a particular emphasis on ventures that address larger societal needs in the area of sustainability and social responsibility.
What is the Entrepreneurial Skills Program (ESP)?
The program is designed to be taken over the length of your time as a student at Dalhousie and therefore shouldn't extend time to degree completion. Successful students will earn a certificate in entrepreneurship in addition to their associated Dalhousie University academic degree in their field of study. The program culminates in the development of a personal portfolio that illustrates a student's entrepreneurial capabilities which is then presented to an accreditation panel. Upon successful completion of ESP, students are accredited and receive a certificate indicating venture readiness.
How do I know if ESP is for me?
Like most things, you probably won’t know till you know. What we can say is that ESP typically appeals to those students who have an interest in being the masters of their own destiny. If you’ve got an idea for a business that you want to start, either during University or after graduation, then you owe it to yourself to get involved with ESP.
What’s in it for me? Why would I want to be part of ESP?
Being part of ESP introduces you to a network of like-minded individuals. It's no surprise that successful people surround themselves with talented, energetic and visionary people. If you want to learn more about being in business for yourself, or if you want to get better at being an entrepreneur, then ESP is a good start.
By enrolling in ESP, you become part of a growing cohort of students that are interested in making a difference in their own lives and the lives of others. Aside from networking and peer-to-peer learning opportunities, you will also have access to training subsidies, business coaching, and skills development opportunities that you can leverage to make yourself a better business owner (or make yourself more marketable as an employee). If you participate in entrepreneurship classes you may be able to pursue your venturing interests while at the same time fulfilling some of the class assignment requirements.
If I sign up, how big a commitment are we talking about?
Students enrolled in ESP are free to choose their degree of involvement. Many students become heavily involved, attending most, if not all, ESP-sponsored events. Others attend a limited number of events. ESP is flexible enough to accommodate you and your personal, academic and professional schedules.
Does Dalhousie offer ESP to other university students?
Yes. Dalhousie offers the ESP program to university students from other local universities and colleges, including Saint Mary's University, Mount Saint Vincent University.
ESP sounds like a lot of work – what if it gets too much for me?
Involvement in ESP is entirely optional. You are free to leave the program at any point. Unlike most academic programs, there's no downside risks (mark-related/academic) associated with dropping ESP.

 Introduction
Pharmacology is the study of the actions and fates of drugs in biological systems. Studies of the interaction of drugs with their receptors and the elucidation of the cellular mechanisms underlying the resulting responses are central to Pharmacology. It is also important to understand how drugs are handled in the body, why they produce adverse effects, and how they interact with each other. In addition, scientists often use drugs as tools to determine the basic mechanisms that underlie both normal and pathological conditions in biology. A solid understanding of the principles of Pharmacology is essential for any scientist who wishes to use drugs as tools properly. The experimental approaches used in Pharmacology are varied, ranging from bioassay, electrophysiology, chemical and biochemical analyses to molecular biology.
Degree Programs
Students intending to pursue graduate training in Pharmacology are encouraged to study pharmacology at the undergraduate level. In addition, a solid background in pharmacology can open the door to employment in numerous sectors, most notably the pharmaceutical industry. The Department of Pharmacology does not offer an honours pharmacology degree program as such. However, it does provide courses that may be taken for credit within various other honours degree programs, including Biology, Biochemistry, Psychology (Neurosciences) and Microbiology and Immunology. In addition, students can conduct honours thesis research projects in the laboratories of Pharmacology faculty. Finally, undergraduate students may, with permission of their home department and the course instructor, take certain graduate specialty courses which are offered in the Department of Pharmacology.

Certificates
Certificates in Science
Certificates are one way that the Faculty of Science recognizes graduating students who have achieved a level of proficiency or specialization in a particular area or subject. Certificates are awarded upon graduation from a degree program and will be recorded on the student’s academic transcript.
Certificates vary in their goals and requirements. Many have a research or practicum component. Some are interdisciplinary, requiring work in more than one department, while others focus on a specialization within a single program. Some Certificates are designed for students enrolled in particular programs, while others are broadly applicable to students in any science program.
In Certificate programs, students enrol by applying to the Certificate Coordinator. Interested students are advised to enrol early in their programs of study, but enrolment is usually also permitted in the final year of study, provided requirements have been met. To be awarded a Certificate, students must notify the Coordinator of their intention to graduate, and provide evidence of completion of all Certificate requirements, prior to the end of the examination period of their final year. Some Certificate programs may require earlier notification; please check with your Coordinator.
Faculty of Science students may also work toward obtaining Certificates offered by other Faculties; some of these are listed in the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements section of the calendar.
The following Certificates are offered by the Faculty of Science. Students enrolled in one of the programs listed beside the Certificate are most likely to be able to meet the Certificate requirements within their programs. Specific Certificate requirements are described below.

Research Project Guidelines for the Certificate in Geographic Information Science
Students should learn how to design, manage and complete a research project that emphasizes the use of a geographic information system (GIS). Students will identify a suitable research problem and work to solve it through acquiring, organizing, analyzing and presenting data using GIS. A substantive analytical component involving GIS must be included. Projects should be undertaken after all or most of the coursework is completed, e.g. students should already be familiar with GIS concepts and functions, and be proficient in the use of at least one GIS package. Supervision and evaluation of research projects must include input from a professor or GIS technician competent in geographic information science, methods and technologies.
Students enrolled in an undergraduate program other than Biology, Environmental Science, Earth Sciences or the College of Sustainability, may be able to complete the project through a directed readings or honours thesis course listed within their home department. The project must be pre-approved by a Certificate Coordinator. Non-thesis students, or honours students who wish to complete the certificate through a project that is not part of their thesis, who are in Biology, Earth Sciences or Environmental Science should complete the project through SCIE 4850: Geographic Information Science Research Project.
Certificate in Information Technology

Introduction
Actuarial Science is the quantitative study of risk, particularly financial risk, and the methods for managing it. It is traditionally associated with insurance and pension plans, but can be applied to a wide range of other areas where there is need for assessment of risk. An Actuarial Science degree provides students with the background for a career in Actuarial Science. Course offerings provide the knowledge and techniques needed by students to prepare to write most of the Society of Actuaries preliminary examinations. Students will learn the relevant mathematical and statistical techniques, with specific applications to Actuarial Science, and acquire a basic understanding of Economics and Business.
The Dalhousie Actuarial Science program is offered through the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.

Introduction
Biochemistry is the study of biological function at the molecular level. Although biochemical processes follow the basic laws of physics and chemistry, living organisms, because of their complexity, operate on a set of distinct principles that are not found in simple isolated chemical systems. The goal of biochemistry is to elucidate these principles. The department offers an integrated series of courses that will provide students with an up-to-date view of modern biochemistry and molecular biology ranging from evolution of genomes to structure-function relationships in macromolecules to the dynamic aspects of metabolism. The core programs can be adapted to emphasize different biochemical specialties such as structural biology, metabolism, molecular biology and cell signaling. Students wishing to pursue advanced studies in related sciences can include courses in Physiology, Pharmacology and/or Pathology in their programs. Greater flexibility is available in combined degree programs of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with another subject; most often with Chemistry, Microbiology, Biology, Neuroscience, Psychology or Environment, Sustainability and Society. Specific programs developed with the Department of Microbiology and Immunology provide coordinated studies of metabolism, enzymology and molecular biology with bacteriology, virology and immunology. These programs provide the foundation for molecular genetics, genetic engineering, biotechnology, biomedical research and medicine.
Laboratory Exercises: Some of the courses offered by the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology include a laboratory component. The laboratory exercises provide an opportunity to develop laboratory skills, as well as to illustrate the theoretical principles taught in course. This process culminates in fourth year, with a supervised research project required for Honours Biochemistry and Molecular Biology students. Although no exercise involves live animals, experiments may use materials derived from animal sources, as well as from plants and micro-organisms. Laboratory experiments will often be performed in groups, but writing of reports is expected to be an individual effort, meeting the guidelines on plagiarism set out in the University Regulations in the Calendar and the Department Policy on Plagiarism.
Degree Programs
The Department offers the following degree programs in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
• BSc (120 credit hour) Honours (Concentrated)*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Combined Honours*

BSc (120 credit hour) Concentrated Honours in
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Students who want a challenging program that results in a broad and in-depth background in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and includes an independent research experience, may want to enroll in an Honours program. Students interested in eventually pursuing graduate studies are particularly encouraged to consider Honours. Honours students complete a minimum of 54 credit hours above the 1000 level in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology subject courses, with a minimum GPA of 3.0, and write a research-based Honours thesis. The Honours thesis and Qualifying Examination requirements are satisfied through completion of BIOC 4604.03/BIOC 4605.03. Because Biochemistry and Chemistry are closely interwoven both conceptually and experimentally, the list of required courses includes both subjects. Additional chemistry courses beyond those required for the honours degree may be taken as electives.
A Co-op option is available for students enrolled in a BSc Concentrated Honours in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. See Co-operative Education Program.

Co-op, Minors, Certificates and Engineering Concurrent
Programs for Students
Co-operative Education Program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Co-op Academic Advisor: Dr. H-S. Ro, Email: Hyo-Sung.Ro@dal.ca
Cooperative Education (Co-op) is a program where academic study in a science subject is combined with paid career-related work experience. Students undertake three work-terms interspersed with their academic study terms. Co-op degree programs enable students to apply their knowledge directly while providing them with work experience that assists in making educated career choices.
Co-op is available to students in BSc (120 credit hour) Honours or Major programs in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, or in Combined Honours or Double Major programs with Biochemistry and Molecular Biology as the primary subject. The number of students admitted into Co-op each year is limited. A minimum GPA of 3.00 is required for admission and for continuation in the Co-op program. Students must be eligible to work in Canada.
Students normally apply to join Co-op during their first year of study. Students must apply before April 15, and it is strongly recommended that interested students meet with their Departmental Co-op advisor early in the Winter term of their first year. If accepted into Co-op, students must register for, and attend the Science Co-op Seminar Series (SCIE 2800.00) in the Fall term of the year they join.
Details are available from the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Co-op Academic Advisor and from the Co- operative Education office www.dal.ca/academics/cooperative_education.html. For more information on Co-op Education in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, please see the Departmental webpage www.dal.ca/academics/programs/undergraduate/bcmb/what_will_I_learn/coop_work_terms.html.
     1706
 
Minors available to students in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Minor programs allow students to develop subject specialties in addition to their major or honours subjects. Minors in other subjects are normally added to 120 credit hour programs (including Co-op).
Students in a BSc (120 credit hour) program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology may choose to include a Minor selected from the list of approved Minors. Courses counted toward a Major or Honours subject cannot be used to fulfill the requirements of a Minor program.
Certificates
In combination with a BSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, students may obtain one or more Certificates. A Certificate indicates that a student has achieved a certain level of proficiency in a given area or subspecialty. Courses counted toward a Major, Honours or Minor subject may also be used to fulfill the requirements of a Certificate. Students must apply to the Certificate Coordinator to be considered for a Certificate. Certificates are awarded upon graduation and are noted on the student’s academic transcript.
A complete list of Faculty of Science Certificates and requirements can be found at Faculty of Science - Certificates. Students may also work toward obtaining Certificates offered by other Faculties; some of these are listed in the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements section.
Certificates of particular interest to students enrolled in a Major or Honours program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology include:
• Certificate in Data Analytics
• Certificate in Genetics
• Certificate in Medicinal Chemistry

Bioinformatics
Bioinformatics
Much of the current research in the biological sciences today requires the handling of “Big Data”. Nowhere is this need more apparent than in the area of genomics, where next generation sequencing techniques are capable of producing, at a relatively low cost, hundreds of gigabytes and even terabytes of DNA sequence data. There is a need for people who have an understanding of molecular and evolutionary genomics (the structure and function
 1715
 
of genes and genomes) and the skill set needed to analyze the data. A Minor in Bioinformatics provides students with an introduction to molecular genomics and to some of the informatics tools currently available.
Coordinator: Dr. Daniel Ruzzante (daniel.ruzzante@dal.ca)
Minor in Bioinformatics
This minor is available to students registered in a 120 credit hour Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) program.
Much of the current research in the biological sciences today requires the handling of “Big Data”. Nowhere is this need more apparent than in the area of genomics, where next generation sequencing techniques are capable of producing, at a relatively low cost, hundreds of gigabytes and even terabytes of DNA sequence data. There is a need for people who have an understanding of molecular and evolutionary genomics (the structure and function of genes and genomes) and the skill set needed to analyze the data. A Minor in Bioinformatics provides students with an introduction to molecular genomics and to some of the informatics tools currently available.
To qualify for a Minor in Bioinformatics, students must take all Required Courses and enough courses from the Selectives list to total 18 credit hours above the 2000 level that count uniquely toward the Minor (e.g. do not also count toward a Major or Honours degree). In addition all students must complete the prerequisite 1000-level courses.
Pathways to obtaining the Minor in Bioinformatics have been designed for students majoring in Computer Science, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Biology, Marine Biology, Statistics and Neuroscience. Students in other programs may obtain the Minor by fulfilling the general requirements below, but should be aware that most of the courses listed have prerequisites, and that they may need to complete a number of courses in addition to the required and selective courses.
Irrespective of path, students with a Bioinformatics Minor will end up having taken a common set of courses in Computer Science, Calculus, Statistics, Genetics, and Molecular Biology or Biochemistry. All students will also receive training in use of ACENET.

 Introduction
Welcome to the Department of Biology. It has been said that the 21st century will be the century of Biology. We are inclined to agree. Biologists study the entire hierarchy of living systems from molecules, cells, organelles and organs to individuals, populations, and ecosystems. Increasingly, the focus of biological inquiry has shifted from reducing living systems into their parts to investigating how these parts interact in complex systems from which novel and unique properties emerge.
The Department of Biology offers both undergraduate and graduate students a wide range of learning experiences and training in the biological sciences. The undergraduate core introduces the student to the whole biological hierarchy and provides an excellent introduction to the biodiversity of species and their habitats. There are multiple avenues for more tailored learning as well, including independent research opportunities, special topics courses, experiential learning, specialty certificates, and honours research. State of the art laboratories provide experience in current technology and experimental design. Our Seaside Program includes a large number of summer field courses covering freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. We excel in Marine Biology as proximity to the Atlantic Ocean gives us the capacity to provide hands-on marine training. In 2014, the Department of Biology began participating in a unique Medical Sciences program that was developed collaboratively by the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Medicine.
There has never been a more exciting time to be a Biologist, nor has the need to understand the intricacies of nature been more urgent. Our comprehensive programs prepare students for a wide range of career options, including research and education, field and laboratory positions, environmental management and conservation, medical sciences and biotechnology, bioengineering, industry, and business. Not every student will use this degree to be a biologist but each one will have the opportunity to participate in and contribute to one of the most worthwhile endeavors in humanity’s near future: understanding nature and how humanity can live better without endangering the multitude of living systems around us, and in turn, ourselves.

In addition to departmental requirements, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Academic Regulations and the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections. Students are advised that a number of requirements differ for the BA and BSc degrees.
A student is governed by the academic regulations in place at the time of initial enrolment, as long as the degree is completed within the time permitted (10 years). Subsequent changes in regulations shall apply only if the student so elects. Student applying the old academic regulations should consult the calendar of the appropriate year.
Students should plan their programs of study carefully and are strongly encouraged to do so in consultation with a Biology undergraduate academic advisor.
Prospective Biology students should be aware that to advance to second year Biology courses, they must achieve at least a C grade in the prerequisite first year Biology courses. Students with exceptional extenuating circumstances may appeal this requirement to the Biology Undergraduate Curriculum Committee. Students should go to the Biology Main Office for further details.

Co-op, Minors, Certificates and Engineering Concurrent
Programs for Students
Co-operative Education Program (Science Co-op) in Biology
Co-op Academic Advisor: Mindy McCarville mindy.mccarville@dal.ca
Science Co-op is a program where academic study in a science subject is combined with paid career-related work experience. Students undertake three work-terms interspersed with their academic study terms. Science Co-op degree programs enable students to apply their knowledge directly while providing them with work experience that assists in making educated career choices.
Science Co-op is available to students in BSc (120 credit hour) Honours or Major programs in Biology, or in Combined Honours or Double Major programs with Biology as the primary subject. The number of students admitted into Science Co-op each year is limited. A minimum GPA of 3.00 is required for admission and for continuation in the Co-op program. Students must be eligible to work in Canada.
      1730

Students normally apply to join Science Co-op during their first year of study, but application during the second year of study is possible. Students must apply before April 15, and it is recommended that interested students contact their Departmental Co-op advisor early in the Winter term of their first year. If accepted into Science Co- op, students must register for, and attend the Science Co-op Seminar Series (SCIE 2800.00) at least four months prior to the first work term.
Details are available from the Biology Co-op Academic Advisor and from the Co-operative Education office http://www.dal.ca/academics/cooperative_education.html. For more information on Co-op Education in Biology, please see the Biology department webpage.
Minors available to students in Biology
Minor programs allow students to develop subject specialties in addition to their major or honours subjects. Minors in other subjects are normally added to 120 credit hour BSc or BA programs (including Science Co-op).
Students in a BSc or BA (120 credit hour) program in Biology may choose to include a Minor selected from the list of approved Minors. Courses counted toward a Major or Honours subject cannot be used to fulfill the requirements of a Minor program.
Certificates
In combination with a BSc or BA in Biology, students may obtain one or more Certificates. A Certificate indicates that a student has achieved a certain level of proficiency in a given area or subspecialty. Courses counted toward a Major, Honours or Minor subject may also be used to fulfill the requirements of a Certificate. Students must apply to the Certificate Coordinator to be considered for a Certificate. Certificates are awarded upon graduation and are noted on the student’s academic transcript.
A complete list of Faculty of Science Certificates and requirements. Students may also work toward obtaining Certificates offered by other Faculties; some of these are listed in the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements section of the calendar.
Certificates of particular interest to student enrolled in a BSc or BA in Biology include:
• Certificate in Animal Behaviour
• Certificate in Aquaculture and the Environment
• Certificate in Environmental Impact Assessment
• Certificate in Genetics
• Certificate in Geographic Information Science
• Certificate in Science Leadership and Communication
BSc/BEng or BA/BEng Concurrent Program
Students interested in combining their interest in Biology with a degree in Engineering may choose a BSc/BEng or BA/BEng Concurrent Program, normally completed in a 5 year period.

Course Selection Guidelines
Biology is a large and diverse field, and students enroll in Biology programs with a corresponding diversity of interests and goals. While we encourage students to sample broadly across the various biological disciplines during their undergraduate years, we recognize that many students wish to emphasize one or more general areas within Biology. To help students select courses that fit their interests and goals, we have identified three general areas in Biology:
A. Ecology and Evolution,
B. Organismal Biology,
C. Cell/Molecular Biology.
Below, we list courses associated with each area, and provide recommendations for designing individual programs at the third and fourth year levels.
IMPORTANT: Students should choose 2000 level courses in their second year with care, so that they will have the necessary pre-requisites to enroll in third and fourth year courses in their interest areas.
NOTE: These are not requirements. Students may select courses from any or all areas, provided they meet requirements for their degree program.
Ecology and Evolution
Ecology and Evolution (E&E) spans a broad range of concepts and applications from ecosystem ecology through population ecology to molecular evolution. A well-rounded course of study in Ecology or Evolution or both will include some courses in basic principles applicable to all organisms and habitats/ecosystems, as well as more specific courses on the details of how these principles play out in particular situations (e.g. taxa, habitats), and how these principles are applied to real world problems. In addition, a well-trained student in E&E should have both well-developed numerical skills as well as exposure to the application of E&E in broader society. Students wishing to emphasize E&E in their degree program should select courses from the following:

Introduction
Chemistry is often called the central science because of its relevance to so many other disciplines. Understanding the composition and properties of matter, as well as the manner in which one substance is transformed into another, is essential to the study of our physical and natural worlds. As such, chemistry is often a starting point for many different careers in science. A variety of programs are available, ranging from focused studies to interdisciplinary options to suit the interests of the student.
A chemistry degree involves considerable breadth of training in the major branches of chemistry. These include organic, inorganic, physical, analytical and biological chemistry. In addition to establishing a solid foundation in the fundamental principles of chemistry, students who undertake a chemistry degree develop essential skills that include problem solving, critical thinking, organization, data analysis, and written and oral communication. The laboratories associated with courses develop the necessary experience with laboratory procedures, equipment and safety, and serve to reinforce the concepts learned in lecture.
Degree Programs
The Department of Chemistry offers the following degree programs in Chemistry
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Honours (Concentrated)*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Combined Honours*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Major*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Double Major*
• BSc or BA (90 credit hour) Minor in Chemistry
• Minor in Chemistry
* BSc Co-op option available
* May be combined with Minor programs from other disciplines
Departmental requirements for each degree program can be seen by following the links in the menu to the right.
In addition to departmental requirements, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Academic Regulations and the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections. Students are advised that a number of requirements differ for the BA and BSc degrees.
A student is governed by the academic regulations in place at the time of initial enrolment in the Faculty of Science, as long as the degree is completed within the time permitted (10 years). Subsequent changes in regulations shall apply only if the student so elects; otherwise the student should consult the calendar of the appropriate year.
The 120 credit hour Concentrated Honours and Major degrees, as well as corresponding Co-op programs, are accredited by the Canadian Society for Chemistry (CSC). CSC accreditation ensures that graduates of these programs have met certain criteria concerning the quantity and quality of their instruction. It qualifies such graduates for membership in the CSC and to practice chemistry as professionals.
Students should plan their programs of study carefully and are strongly encouraged to do so in consultation with a Chemistry undergraduate academic advisor.
Students who participated in the Integrated Science Program in their first year should consult the Undergraduate Calendar for first year course equivalencies.

Co-operative Education Program (Science Co-op) in Chemistry
Co-op Academic Advisor: Dr. Alan Doucette alan.doucette@dal.ca
     1767
 
Science Co-op is a program where academic study in a science subject is combined with paid career-related work experience. Students undertake three work-terms interspersed with their academic study terms. Science Co-op degree programs enable students to apply their knowledge directly while providing them with work experience that assists in making educated career choices.
Science Co-op is available to students in BSc (120 credit hour) Honours or Major programs, or in Combined Honours or Double Major programs. The number of students admitted into Science Co-op each year is limited. A minimum GPA of 3.00 is required for admission and for continuation in the Co-op program. Students must be eligible to work in Canada.
Students normally apply to join Science Co-op during their first year of study. Students must apply before April 15, and it is strongly recommended that interested students meet with their Departmental Co-op advisor early in the Winter term of their first year. If accepted into Science Co-op, students must register for, and attend the Science Co-op Seminar Series (SCIE 2800.00) at least four months prior to the first work term.
Details are available from the Chemistry Co-op Academic Advisor and from the Co-operative Education office www.dal.ca/academics/cooperative_education.html. For more information on Co-op Education in Chemistry please see the departmental page www.dal.ca/faculty/science/chemistry/programs/undergraduate- studies/degree-programs/co-operative-education.html
Minors available to students in Chemistry

 Introduction
Earth Science is a holistic discipline whose focus of study is the Earth System. It includes the geosciences which address the solid earth, but necessarily also extends to study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans and biosphere. Broadly, Earth scientists work to understand
1. how the Earth System works;
2. how it evolved to its current state;
3. the processes for and distribution of Earth's physical resources such as fossil fuels, minerals, and water;
and
4. limits to and consequences of the use of physical resources by humans.
Examples of specific questions within Earth Sciences include: How was the Earth formed? What is its composition? Where do we look for oil? Where do we look for reliable water supplies? What are the relationships between glaciers, rivers, and climate, both now and in the deep past? To answer questions such as these, Earth scientists typically use methods from the foundation sciences -- physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics - along with discipline-specific methods and modern tools including computing and satellite mapping. Some Earth scientists also consider or draw expertise from the social sciences, particularly as humans collectively become a significant agent in modifying components of the Earth System.
Career paths
Earth Science is of tremendous importance to Canadians and can be an immensely satisfying profession. Earth scientists are employed in universities, government agencies, the oil, gas and mineral industries, environmental consulting, and beyond. The Earth Sciences department offers programs and courses designed to meet the needs of students with varying goals for her/his undergraduate education. In general, the following summary recommendations can be made:
• To prepare to become a professional geoscientist, students should enroll in a 120 credit hour BSc or BA degree (Major, Honours or Combined) and meet the knowledge requirements for professional registration by following the Geoscience Knowledge and Experience handbook available at https://geoscientistscanada.ca.
• To prepare for postgraduate study (MSc or PhD) in Earth Sciences or a related field, students should pursue a BSc Concentrated Honours in Earth Sciences or Combined Honours with a related subject, and consider meeting requirements of professional registration (above).
 1785
 
• Students seeking an undergraduate preparation for Law, Education, or another professional program outside of Earth Sciences, or to complement another subject, should consider a BSc or BA Major or Double Major.
• Electives courses and Minors: Earth Sciences is about understanding how the Earth 'works'. As such it makes an excellent general education subject. Several ERTH courses that may be suitable electives are listed below.
General interest courses
These courses are designed to be accessible to students who want to know something about the Earth, but whose major field of study is not Earth Sciences. For example, the course may be of interest to an economics student concerned with resources, a history student interested in the role played by Canada’s geological framework in the development of transportation, a biology student interested in faunal environments on the seafloor.
Courses without prerequisites
• ERTH 1030.03: Introduction to Physical Geography
• ERTH 1060.03: Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Natural Disasters
• ERTH 1080.03: Geology I (lab course)
Courses with prerequisites
• ERTH 1090.03: Geology II (with lab)
• ERTH 1091.03: Geology II (non-lab course)
• ERTH 2410.03: Environmental Issues in Earth Sciences
• ERTH 2420.03: Dinosaurs
• ERTH 2205.03: Introduction to Paleontology (lab course)
• ERTH 3440.03: Geomorphology
High School Preparation
Students in high school who plan a career in Earth Sciences, should have Advanced Math or Pre-calculus Math, plus Chemistry and Physics. Note that only Mathematics is required as a prerequisite, but the others are strongly recommended. A student should ideally aim to make up deficiencies in high school preparation in the first year at Dalhousie.
Degree Programs
The Department of Earth Sciences offers the following degree programs in Earth Sciences
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Honours (Concentrated)*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Combined Honours*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Major*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Double Major*
• BSc or BA (90 credit hour) Minor in Earth Sciences
• Minor in Earth Sciences
* BSc Co-op option available
* May be combined with Minor programs from other disciplines
Departmental Requirements for these programs are described below. In addition to departmental requirements, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Academic Regulations and the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections. Students are advised that a number of requirements differ for the BA and BSc degrees.
     1786

A student is governed by the academic regulations in place at the time of initial enrolment, as long as the degree is completed within the time permitted (10 years). Subsequent changes in regulations shall apply only if the student so elects. Student applying the old academic regulations should consult the calendar of the appropriate year.
Students should plan their programs of study carefully and are strongly encouraged to do so in consultation with an Earth Sciences undergraduate academic advisor.

Co-op, Minors, Certificates and Engineering Concurrent
Programs for Students
Co-operative Education Program (Science Co-op) in Earth Sciences
Co-op Academic Advisor: Dr. Richard Cox richard.cox@dal.ca
Science Co-op is a program of academic study in a science subject, combined with paid career-related work experience. Students undertake three work-terms interspersed with their academic study terms. Science Co-op degree programs enable students to apply their knowledge directly while providing them with work experience that assists in making educated career choices.
Science Co-op is available to students in BSc (120 credit hour) Honours or Major programs in Earth Sciences, or in Combined Honours or Double Major programs with Earth Sciences as the primary subject. The number of students
    1792
 
admitted into Science Co-op each year is limited. A minimum GPA of 3.00 is required for admission and for continuation in the Co-op program. Students must be eligible to work in Canada.
Students normally apply to join Science Co-op during their first year of study. Students must apply before April 15, and it is strongly recommended that interested students meet with their Departmental Co-op advisor early in the Winter term of their first year. If accepted into Science Co-op, students must register for, and attend the Science Co-op Seminar Series (SCIE 2800.00) at least four months prior to the first work term.
Details are available from the Earth Sciences Co-op Academic Advisor and from the Co-operative Education office
www.dal.ca/academics/cooperative_education.html
Minors available to students in Earth Sciences
Minor programs allow students to develop subject specialties in addition to their major or honours subjects. Minors in other subjects are normally added to 120 credit hour BSc or BA programs (including Science Co-op).
Students in a BSc or BA (120 credit hour) program in Earth Sciences may choose to include a Minor selected from the list of approved Minors. Courses counted toward a Major or Honours subject cannot be used to fulfill the requirements of a Minor program.
Certificates
In combination with a BSc or BA in Earth Sciences, students may obtain one or more Certificates. A Certificate indicates that a student has achieved a certain level of proficiency in a given area or subspecialty. Courses counted toward a Major, Honours or Minor subject may also be used to fulfill the requirements of a Certificate. Students must apply to the Certificate Coordinator to be considered for a Certificate. Certificates are awarded upon graduation and are noted on the student’s academic transcript.
A complete list of Faculty of Science Certificates and requirements can be found at the beginning of the Faculty of Science section. Students may also work toward obtaining Certificates offered by other Faculties; some of these are listed in the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements section.
Certificates of particular interest to students enrolled in a BSc or BA program in Earth Sciences include:
• Certificate in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) (contact: Dr. Patricia Lane, Biology, patricia.lane@dal.ca)
• Certificate in Geographic Information Science (GIS) (contact: Dr. Chris Greene, Earth Sciences, csgreene@dal.ca)

Knowledge Requirements for Professional Practice as a Geoscientist
Geoscience is a regulated profession in most of Canada. Individual provinces and territories have acts that restrict the practice of geoscience to individuals who are registered members of professional associations. In Nova Scotia, the Association of Professional Geoscientists of Nova Scotia (APGNS) is the licensing body which fulfils this mandate. APGNS and other provincial geoscience associations, under the guidance of Geoscientists Canada, ensure high standards of geoscience practice and education.
Students who intend to pursue geoscience as a profession, or simply want the most in-depth education in geoscience, should follow the guidelines laid out in the Geoscience Knowledge and Experience handbook provided by Geoscientists Canada. The Geoscience Knowledge and Experience handbook outlines comprehensive sequences of courses intended to prepare a student for professional practice in modern geoscience, and to meet formal requirements for registration in the Geology and Environmental Geoscience streams.
          1793

Professional geoscience knowledge requirements are more specific and stringent than degree requirements in terms of the courses required in Earth Sciences and in the Foundation Sciences (mathematics and physics in particular). Earth Science students can meet the knowledge requirements within a 120 credit hour degree by careful selection of ERTH courses and Foundation Science courses, and this should begin in the first year. Less than judicious course selection, and/or combining Earth Science with another subject which also has numerous specific course requirements, may result in a student needing extra courses (beyond the 120 credit hours) in order to meet knowledge requirements for registration. Consult the professional associations -- Geoscientists Canada and APGNS - for additional information on registration.
BSc/BEng or BA/BEng Concurrent Program
Students interested in combining their interest in Program with a degree in Engineering may choose a BSc/BEng or BA/BEng Concurrent Program, normally completed in a 5 year period. Over the first three years, students complete the requirements for a 90 credit hour BSc or BA degree in Earth Sciences and a Diploma of Engineering (the first two years of engineering studies). Two more years of engineering studies are then required to obtain a BEng. Interested students should see undergraduate advisors from Earth Sciences and from the Faculty of Engineering in their first year of study.
Field Work
Field excursions are part of many courses and are conducted at appropriate times during the session. In addition, some optional field excursions may be held each year. Note that some mandatory field trips may be held on Saturdays or Sundays. Field School, ERTH 3001, which is required for most degree programs, is offered for about 15 days in late August, just before the start of the University fall term.

We currently face daunting environmental challenges at the global scale that are expected to worsen in the 21st century, including a global water crisis, climate change and pollution of our waters and atmosphere; this course examines the science behind these environmental issues from the multidisciplinary framework of global biogeochemical cycling. With the global scale as the focus, this course pulls together the many disparate fields that are encompassed by the broad reach of biogeochemistry. You will learn about the processes that drive the movement of carbon, water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur, through the earth system, and the residency of these elements in the atmosphere, soils, lithosphere, oceans and freshwaters. In the quantitative and analytical exercises you calculate and compare the effects of industrial emissions, land clearing, agriculture, and rising population on the processes driving the Earth's chemical cycles. Weekly journal readings for discussion in laboratory group cover the latest developments in this exciting and rapidly changing field. This course provides an excellent framework for those interested in the science of global change.

 Introduction
Economics is a social science - a science because it involves a rigorous intellectual effort to derive logical conclusions from basic facts and propositions; a social science because it has human beings and their welfare as its ultimate concern. The basic facts of Economics cannot be knowable and measurable with the same precision as those of the physical sciences - human society and its motivations are far too complex to permit this - but none of the sciences surpasses economics in its relevance to our needs, problems and goals.
Economics analyzes the equity, efficiency, and sustainability of human behavior in the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities. Economics is not an easy science; indeed, it is one of the most complex, difficult (and fascinating) areas of study when you pursue it beyond its elementary levels, but some basic knowledge of economics is essential for any educated person. A more extensive knowledge of the subject is an invaluable complement to other fields of specialization such as law, commerce, politics and other studies in social sciences or humanities, and a specialization in the field can lead to a variety of interesting career opportunities.
Degree Programs
The Department of Economics offers the following degree programs in Economics
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Honours (Concentrated)*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Combined Honours*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Major*

BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Concentrated Honours in
Economics
Students who want a challenging program that results in a broad background in Economics and includes an independent research experience, may want to enroll in an Honours program. Students interested in eventually pursuing graduate studies are particularly encouraged to consider Honours. Honours students complete a minimum of 54 credit hours above the 1000 level in Economics with a minimum GPA of 3.3 and write a research- based Honours thesis. The Honours Qualifying Examination requirement is satisfied through completion of ECON 4201.03 / ECON 4202 : Honours Thesis I and II.
Students interested in eventually pursuing a Masters in Economics are advised to choose the BSc Honours option in order to acquire the needed analytical skills. In contrast, the the BA Honours program provides a broad background in Economics which is excellent prepation for a wide variety of other post-graduate programs.
Admission to Concentrated Honours
Students must apply for admission to Honours programs. Students considering Honours in Economics should consult with an Economics Undergraduate Advisor early in their studies.
To be admitted to the BSc Concentrated Honours program, students must

Introduction
Environmental Science in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences offers several programs. These include a BSc Honours/Major in Environmental Science, a Minor in Environmental Science, a Double Major in Environmental Science and Community Design, and a BSc or BA Double Major or Combined Honours in Environmental Science and any Major/Honours subject in the Faculty of Science, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS) or with the College of Sustainability. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS), the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Computer Science and the Faculty of Architecture and Planning also offer a Minor in Environmental Studies which is administered through Environmental Science.
Environmental Science applies the findings and principles from multiple disciplines to environmental questions and problems. Environmental Science, by nature, is multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. Most environmental scientists develop expertise in a particular discipline, and work co-operatively with specialists in other disciplines to solve environmental problems. They work in a variety of institutions in both the public and private sectors: municipal, provincial and federal government departments, consulting and engineering companies, development aid organizations in the non-governmental sector and activist community organizations. In all of these institutions they must integrate their scientific knowledge into the prevailing political, economic and legal systems.
The courses required for the BSc Environmental Science stress the links among the fields of study that the students acquire. Thus, students graduate with a combination of depth and breadth of knowledge and the ability to solve problems in the real world.
Degree Programs
The Faculty of Science offers the following degree programs in Environmental Science
• BSc (120 credit hour) Honours (Concentrated)*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Combined Honours*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Major*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Double Major*
• Minor in Environmental Science
• Minor in Environmental Studies
* BSc Co-op option available
* May be combined with Minor programs from other disciplines
Program Requirements can be seen by following the links to the right. In addition to the program requirements, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Academic Regulations and the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections. Students are advised that a number of requirements differ for the BA and BSc degrees.
A student is governed by the academic regulations in place at the time of initial enrolment, as long as the degree is completed within the time permitted (10 years). Subsequent changes in regulations shall apply only if the student so elects. Student applying the old academic regulations should consult the calendar of the appropriate year.
Students should plan their programs of study carefully and are strongly encouraged to do so in consultation with the Environmental Science undergraduate academic advisor.

BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Combined Honours in
Environmental Science and another subject
Students who wish to study Environmental Science in conjunction with another subject may wish to pursue a Combined Honours degree program. The other subject may be any discipline from the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Computer Science, or the College of Sustainability. Environmental Science may be the primary subject (defined as the subject with the larger number of honours credits), or the secondary subject.
Students planning to enroll in a Combined Honours program should consult with academic advisors from both programs early in their studies. The same standards and conditions for admission apply as for entry into a Concentrated Honours program (see above). In addition, students must have their program of study approved by Academic Advisors in both subject areas. Students must complete an Honours Qualifying Examination in one of the two subject areas, a requirement normally completed in the primary subject area. For Environmental Science, this requirement is satisfied through ENVS 4901.03 and ENVS 4902.03.
A Co-op option is available for students enrolled in BSc Combined Honours with Environmental Science as the primary subject. See Co-operative Education Program.

Co-op, Minors, Certificates and Engineering Concurrent Programs for Students
Co-operative Education Program (Science Co-op) in Environmental Science
Co-opAcademicAdvisor: Dr.TarahWrighttarah.wright@dal.ca
Science Co-op is a program where academic study in a science subject is combined with paid career-related work experience. Students undertake three work-terms interspersed with their academic study terms. Science Co-op degree programs enable students to apply their knowledge directly while providing them with work experience that assists in making educated career choices.
Science Co-op is available to students in BSc (120 credit hour) Honours or Major programs in Environmental Science, or in Combined Honours or Double Major programs with Environmental Science as the primary subject. The number of students admitted into Science Co-op each year is limited. A minimum GPA of 3.00 is required for admission and for continuation in the Co-op program. Students must be eligible to work in Canada.
Students normally apply to join Science Co-op during their first year of study. Students must apply before April 15, and it is strongly recommended that interested students meet with their Departmental Co-op advisor early in the Winter term of their first year. If accepted into Science Co-op, students must register for, and attend the Science Co-op Seminar Series (SCIE 2800.00) at least four months prior to the first work term.
Details are available from the Environmental Science Co-op Academic Advisor and from the Co-operative Education office http://www.dal.ca/academics/cooperative_education.html. For more information on Co-op Education in Environmental Science, please see www.dal.ca/environment.

Minors available to students in Environmental Science
Minor programs allow students to develop subject specialties in addition to their major or honours subjects. Minors in other subjects are normally added to 120 credit hour BSc or BA programs (including Science Co-op).
Students in a BSc or BA (120 credit hour) program in Environmental Science may choose to include a Minor selected from the list of approved Minors. Courses counted toward a Major or Honours subject cannot be used to fulfill the requirements of a Minor program.
Certificates
In combination with a BSc or BA in Environmental Science, students may obtain one or more Certificates. A Certificate indicates that a student has achieved a certain level of proficiency in a given area or subspecialty. Courses counted toward a Major, Honours or Minor subject may also be used to fulfill the requirements of a Certificate. Students must apply to the Certificate Coordinator to be considered for a Certificate. Certificates are awarded upon graduation and are noted on the student’s academic transcript.
A complete list of Faculty of Science Certificates and requirements can be found at the beginning of the Faculty of Science section. Students may also work toward obtaining Certificates offered by other Faculties; some of these are listed in the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements.

First Year Interest Groups (FIGs)
First Year Interest Groups (FIGs)
 1873
 
a start for university success
What is a FIG and why sign up?
A First Year Interest Group, or FIG, is a group of students who meet weekly for an hour during the fall term of their first year at Dal. Groups are composed of about 15 students who have similar academic interests or goals, and who are enrolled in one or more of the same first year courses.
FIGs are designed to complement the classroom experience. It’s a place to meet other first year students, and to discuss some of the big ideas emerging in your future field of study. Signing up for a FIG can help you get involved, meet people, and maybe even form lasting friendships. FIGs are free, informal, interactive groups that will help you make the most out of your first year at Dal.
What will you do in a FIG?
• Get to know other first year students with similar interests (maybe you’ll find a study partner)
• Meet Dal faculty or professionals who work in your area of interest
• Find out how to get involved (volunteer opportunities, events, clubs)
• Learn about future opportunities for students with your interests (scholarships, summer research, co-
op, study abroad)
• Talk!
Who should enrol in a FIG?
Any student in the Faculty of Science who has been accepted as an undeclared Science student and is in their first year of studies can enrol in a FIG.
How do I enrol in a FIG?
You enroll in a FIG when you registered for your regular courses, using the same registration procedure. First, make sure that the time slot of the FIG doesn’t conflict with the lecture, lab or tutorial times of your other courses. Then register for the appropriate FIG section (FIGS 0001, 0002, etc.).
Does a FIG count toward my degree?
The FIG will appear on your academic transcript – it can be seen by future employers along with the credit courses you complete. However, because it is not for credit, a FIG does not count as part of the 90 or 120 credit hours you must complete for a BSc degree.
Will I receive a grade for my FIG?
If you complete the FIG, it will appear on your academic transcript with Pass noted beside it. Letter grades are not given for FIGs, and FIGs are not included in calculation of your GPA. However, to receive a Pass you must participate in the FIG sessions.
What if I don’t like my FIG?
We expect that most students will enjoy their FIG, and will feel that the time has been well spent. However, if for some reason you find that you do not want to participate in your FIG, you may withdraw. The FIG will then not appear on your transcript.
Can I sign up for more than one FIG?
No. We want to offer the opportunity to participate in a FiG to as many students as possible, and so students may not register in more than one FIG.

Earthquakes, meteorite impacts, rapid climate change, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, landslides, solar flares, and floods are natural disasters that affect our economy, public policy, and safety. Where, why and how frequently do natural disasters occur? Are predictions possible? Are media portrayals of risk and damage realistic? This course, aimed at the nonspecialist, investigates these intriguing questions. Excerpts of “disaster films”, in conjunction with lectures and discussions are used to identify the causes, consequences and sometimes erroneous perceptions of natural hazards. Examples from Atlantic Canada and contemporary disasters are used to assess local risk and real-time events worldwide.

GEOG 2100 Environment and Culture
CREDIT HOURS: 6
Concern about the environment is a widespread phenomenon as virtually everyone is confronted by environmental issues -- be they global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer or the continuing problems of water pollution and solid waste disposal. Furthermore, we are becoming increasingly aware of that environmental issues often have global implications. The efforts of cities in Canada to deal with environmental pollution, for example, may lead to conflicts with rural regions. Similarly, rural regions, in their use of various chemical agents, may find themselves affecting the lives of city dwellers. This class will explore key relationships between human culture and the physical environment. Topics to be examined include: historical, social, and legal aspects of contemporary environmentalism, food and agriculture, environmental ethics, health, traditional ecological knowledge, sustainable forestry, waste management, public participation and environmental movements.

GEOG 2800 Climate Change
CREDIT HOURS: 3
Most models of the atmosphere predict that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will continue to warm the surface of the earth and the oceans in the twenty-first century. The magnitude of the warming and its consequences are still very controversial. This class will discuss, mainly from a nonmathematical viewpoint, the reasons for the greenhouse effect, the current warming in the context of the historical record of climate change, and sources of natural climate variability such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation. It will also review arguments that attribute the warming that has occurred in the Twentieth century to natural variability, and those that attribute the warming to increased human emission of greenhouse gases.

 Introduction
Dalhousie's Integrated Science Program is a unique and engaging way for a serious and well-prepared student to complete the first year of a BSc degree. In addition to learning the core material of several first-year science
 1889

subjects, students gain an interdisciplinary perspective, develop transferrable skills, and conduct research, all in their first year. The goals of the program are:
1. To engage students in the process of scientific inquiry with hands-on experience in scientific research skills.
2. To provide a strong academic background for second-year courses in the subjects covered by the program.
3. To identify links among the science disciplines.
4. To learn effective team skills.
5. To explore the relevance of science for society at large.
The Integrated Science program exposes first year students to a broad range of science disciplines in an integrated manner, and provides a strong foundation for most BSc programs. Students learn from a team of instructors with expertise in particular subject areas, who also highlight the natural links among disciplines. Integrated Science students are members of a small cohort (maximum 80) who take the majority of their lectures, labs and field trips together.
The Integrated Science program has a strong emphasis on research-relevant training. Students study experimental design, collect and analyze data in the laboratory and during field trips, work on communication skills, including scientific writing, and are introduced to some of the ethical questions that arise in the practice of science. In the winter term, students undertake an independent research project under the supervision of a Dalhousie-affiliated researcher, which culminates in a presentation at a conference-style event.
Integrated Science consists of a core program taken only by IS students, and auxiliary courses taken together with other first year BSc students. The core program covers Biology, Psychology, Earth Sciences, Statistics, and Ethics in Science. Auxiliary courses include Chemistry, Math and Physics (optional). Exposure to multiple science disciplines can also be helpful for students who are unsure which subjects interest them most, and early training in research is especially valuable for those considering an Honours program. Integrated Science is also excellent preparation for professional graduate programs, such as Law or Medicine.
Integrated Science candidates should be highly-motivated, have a strong interest in science, and be willing to think across discipline boundaries. They should be enthusiastic about being part of a small cohort of students intent on learning how to work and think like scientists; they should want to learn to be cooperative and effective team members; they should have good study, work, and time-management skills; and they should welcome the challenge to work hard, to think critically, and to solve problems.
Students wishing to enter this program normally must have a minimum Grade 12 average of 80%, with a minimum of 80% in Mathematics and 70% English, and a minimum of 75% in two of Grade 12 Chemistry, Biology or Physics. The average high school mark of incoming Integrated Science students is around 90%. Students must be accepted to the Integrated Science Program as well as be accepted to the BSc at Dalhousie University.

Choosing an Integrated Science Option
Integrated Science is a full-time, first-year program designed to prepare BSc students for second year courses in multiple science programs. The IS program emphasizes the connections among the different science disciplines, and provides students with research training and experience. Students take the core program as a cohort (max 80 students).
The core consists of two 9-credit-hour courses, Integrated Science I (SCIE 1506.09), and Integrated Science II (SCIE 1507.09), as well as Ethics in Science (PHIL 1050.03). In the fall, students have lectures, laboratories and field trips in Biology, Psychology and Statistics, and receive training in research skills (experimental design, analysis, scientific writing). The winter term consists of lectures and laboratories in Biology, Psychology and Earth Sciences, and students conduct a 10-week independent research project in a Dalhousie or Dalhousie-affiliated research lab. Students present the results of their research at a conference-style event.
Integrated Science I and II are equivalent to two terms of Biology and Psychology, and one term of Earth Sciences and Statistics. Together with PHIL 1050: Ethics in Science, the core fulfills the writing requirement for BSc students.
Students also register for several auxiliary or co-requisite courses; these are taken along with other BSc students, typically in larger classes. Students take a full year of Chemistry (CHEM 1011.03/CHEM 1012.03) and a half year of Calculus (MATH 1000.03 or MATH 1215.03). Students have the option to enroll in a second term of Calculus (MATH 1010.03) and to take Physics (full year or half year). See co-requisite details below:

**In the winter term, Integrated Science students may take an overload (18 credit hours), a regular full course load (15 credit hours,) or a lighter course load of 12 credit hours (if they choose not to take MATH or PHYSICS in winter).
Choice of Math and Physics courses
Prior to selecting Math or Physics courses please consult the course descriptions in the Dalhousie Academic Calendar.
• PHYC 1190/PHYC 1290 is designed for students in Physical Sciences and Engineering, and PHYC 1310/ PHYC 1320 is designed for students in Life Sciences.
• MATH 1000 should be taken by students interested in math, economics or the physical sciences, while MATH 1215 is designed for life sciences students.
• One calculus course (MATH 1000.03 or MATH 1215.03) together with SCIE 1506.09 (Statistics) satisfies the full math requirement for BSc students. Students who do not require MATH 1010 for their programs have the option to take only one calculus course.

Introduction
The Marine Biology Program offers students the opportunity to study and experience marine life, from the tiny plankton that drive ocean ecosystems to the sharks and marine mammals at the top of the food chain. In the first two years of the program, Marine Biology students obtain a basic grounding in Biology and start to learn the basics of how the ocean works. They then use their third and fourth years to study in greater depth the diversity, physiology, ecology, and evolution of marine animals and plants. Many students combine their studies of marine biology with courses in the chemistry or physics of the ocean. Marine Biology students are offered a Co-op option, where three work terms in industry, government or university laboratories, or ecotourism are included within the program.
The Biology department is located adjacent to the sea in the Life Sciences Centre. All eight floors have running sea water, and we have a 15m pool tank and a 10m deep tower tank. Within a 30 km radius there are salt marshes, rocky shores, estuaries, and sand beaches for field work.
Our students have many opportunities to participate in marine-related research; examples can be viewed on our website. "Ocean studies" is an area of special emphasis for Dalhousie University, and thus many faculty members have active research programs in marine science. In addition, many marine scientists at local research institutions, including the Bedford Institute of Oceanography and the Institute for Marine Biosciences serve as supervisors for our Honours students.
An undergraduate major in Marine Biology at Dalhousie qualifies you for technical positions in places like government fisheries laboratories, aquaculture farms, and consulting firms. In the Marine Biology program’s summer field courses or in the honours research courses, you’ll get plenty of hands-on opportunities to explore the ocean—preparing you for the exciting challenges of diverse marine-related careers.
Degree Programs
The Department of Biology offers the following degree programs in Marine Biology
• BSc (120 credit hour) Honours (Concentrated)*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Combined Honours*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Major*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Double Major*
• Minor in Marine Biology * BSc Co-op option available
* May be combined with Minor programs from other disciplines
Departmental requirements for each degree program can be seen by following the links in the menu at the right.
In addition to departmental requirements, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Academic Regulations and the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections.
A student is governed by the academic regulations in place at the time of initial enrolment, as long as the degree is completed within the time permitted (10 years). Subsequent changes in regulations shall apply only if the student so elects. Student applying the old academic regulations should consult the calendar of the appropriate year.
Students should plan their programs of study carefully and are strongly encouraged to do so in consultation with a Marine Biology undergraduate academic advisor.
Prospective Marine Biology students should be aware that to advance to the second year Biology courses in the Marine Biology program, they must achieve at least a C grade in the prerequisite first year Biology courses. Students with exceptional extenuating circumstances may appeal this requirement to the Biology Undergraduate Curriculum Committee. Students should go to the Biology Main Office for further details.

Co-operative Education Program (Science Co-op) in Marine Biology
Co-op Academic Advisor: Dr. N McAllister-Irwin (nancy.mcallister-irwin@dal.ca)
   1902
 
Science Co-op is a program where academic study in a science subject is combined with paid career-related work experience. Students undertake three work-terms interspersed with their academic study terms. Science Co-op degree programs enable students to apply their knowledge directly while providing them with work experience that assists in making educated career choices.
Science Co-op is available to students in BSc (120 credit hour) Honours or Major programs in Marine Biology, or in Combined Honours or Double Major programs with Marine Biology as the primary subject. The number of students admitted into Science Co-op each year is limited. A minimum GPA of 3.00 is required for admission and for continuation in the Co-op program. For entry into Marine Biology Co-op, a minimum grade of B+ in BIOL 1010.03 is required. Students must be eligible to work in Canada.
Students normally apply to join Science Co-op during their first year of study, but application during the second year of study is possible. Students must apply before April 15, and it is recommended that interested students meet contact their Departmental Co-op advisor early in the Winter term of their first year. If accepted into Science Co-op, students must register for, and attend the Science Co-op Seminar Series (SCIE 2800.00) at least four months prior to the first work term.
Details are available from the Marine Biology/Co-op Academic Advisor and from the Co-operative Education office www.dal.ca/academics/cooperative_education.html. For more information on Co-op Education in Marine Biology, please see the Departmental webpage www.dal.ca/academics/programs/undergraduate/marinebio/what_will_I_learn/coop_work_terms.html
Minors available to students in Marine Biology
Minor programs allow students to develop subject specialties in addition to their major or honours subjects. Minors in other subjects are normally added to 120 credit hour BSc or BA programs (including Science Co-op).
Students in a BSc (120 credit hour) program in Marine Biology may choose to include a Minor selected from the list of approved Minors. Courses counted toward a Major or Honours subject cannot be used to fulfill the requirements of a Minor program.
Certificates
In combination with a BSc in Marine Biology, students may obtain one or more Certificates. A Certificate indicates that a student has achieved a certain level of proficiency in a given area or subspecialty. Courses counted toward a Major, Honours or Minor subject may also be used to fulfill the requirements of a Certificate. Students must apply to the Certificate Coordinator to be considered for a Certificate. Certificates are awarded upon graduation and are noted on the student’s academic transcript.
A complete list of Faculty of Science Certificates and requirements can be found at the beginning of the Faculty of Science section. Students may also work toward obtaining Certificates offered by other Faculties; some of these are listed in the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements section.

 Introduction
The Mathematics division offers a full range of programs aimed at students of diverse interests and levels. This includes honours, major, minor and joint degree programs. We work closely with students to choose a program that is the right fit for their interests and goals. Mathematics is a creative activity with its own intrinsic value and beauty. Mathematics also provides a solid foundation for every scientific field. A degree in mathematics can prepare students for a career in academia, industry, management, information technology, banking, teaching, and other areas.
General Interest Courses
We offer a number of courses for students not majoring in Mathematics:
• MATH 1000.03/MATH 1010.03: These core calculus courses are the starting point for any degree program in the sciences.
• MATH 1030.03 This course along with 2040.03 serve as introductions to matrix theory, linear equations and linear algebra, topics of importance in many fields.
• MATH 1060.03: This course serves as an introduction to the basic ideas of statistics, through examples drawn from a wide variety of disciplines.
• MATH 1115.03: Linear algebra and calculus are arranged to meet the needs of commerce students, but of interest to anyone wishing a brief introduction to these topics.
• MATH 1215.03: This course emphasizes the application of calculus to the life sciences.
 1920
 
• MATH 2112.03: Whereas calculus deals with continuous phenomena, this course deals with discrete objects, especially varieties of ways to count.
MATH 2040.03: This course along with 1030.03 serve as introductions to matrix theory, linear equations and linear algebra, topics of importance in many fields.
• MATH 2300.03: Topics from science and technology are used to motivate and illustrate basic mathematical tools of linear algebra and calculus. Mathematical software such as Matlab and Maple is also introduced.
Six credit hours of Mathematics or Statistics are required for a BSc degree. The following courses may not be used to satisfy this requirement: MATH 1001.03, MATH 1002.03, MATH 1003.03, MATH 1115.03.
Degree Programs
The Department of Mathematics and Statistics offers the following degree programs in Mathematics
• BSc (120 credit hour) Honours (Concentrated)*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Combined Honours*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Major*
• BSc or BA (120 credit hour) Double Major*
• BSc (90 credit hour) Minor in Mathematics
• Minor in Mathematics (added to a 120 credit hour degree)
* May be combined with Minor programs from other disciplines
Departmental requirements for each degree program can be seen by following the links in the menu to the right.
In addition to departmental requirements, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Academic Regulations and the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections.
A BSc degree is the choice of most students in Mathematics; however, a BA degree option is also available for each of the programs listed below. The Departmental requirements for each BA degree program are the same as those of the corresponding BSc degree program; however, students are advised that some of the general College of Arts and Science requirements differ for the BA and BSc degrees. Minors and certificates that can be combined with a BSc degree can also be combined with a BA degree.
A student is governed by the academic regulations in place at the time of initial enrolment, as long as the degree is completed within the time permitted (10 years). Subsequent changes in regulations shall apply only if the student so elects. Students applying the old academic regulations should consult the calendar of the appropriate year.
Students should plan their programs of study carefully and are strongly encouraged to do so in consultation with a Mathematics undergraduate academic advisor. Students who participated in the Integrated Science Program in their first year should consult the Undergraduate Calendar for first year course equivalencies.
Students in any Mathematics program are strongly encouraged to include CSCI 1100.03 and CSCI 1101.03 in their programs.

Honours Comprehensive Examination
The Honours Comprehensive Examination in mathematics consists of a written paper of about 20-30 pages researched and prepared by the student. The topic is decided on in conjunction with the Honours advisor. The paper is also presented to the honours seminar. The work for this paper is done as part of the required course MATH 4950.03: Honours Research Project.
BSc (120 credit hour) Combined Honours in
Mathematics and another subject
Students who wish to study Mathematics in conjunction with another subject may wish to pursue a Combined Honours degree program. The other subject may be any discipline from the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Computer Science, or the College of Sustainability. Mathematics may be the primary subject (defined as the subject with the larger number of honours credits), or the secondary subject. Students contemplating a Combined Honours program in Mathematics and another subject should bear in mind, however, that the work in either subject may be insufficient for admission to a regular graduate program.
Students planning to enrol in a Combined Honours program should consult with academic advisors from both programs early in their studies. The same standards and conditions for admission apply as for entry into a Concentrated Honours program (see above). In addition, students must have their program of study approved by
 1925
 
Academic Advisors in both subject areas. Students must complete an Honours Qualifying Examination in one of the two subject areas, a requirement normally completed in the primary subject area. For Mathematics, this requirement is satisfied through MATH 4950.03.
Departmental Requirements
Students in a BSc Combined Honours program in Mathematics and another subject must fulfill the requirements outlined in the Academic Regulations and College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections. A combined total of 66 credit hours above the 1000 level must be completed in two subjects, with a minimum of 30 credit hours above the 1000 level in each subject. In addition, students must complete a minimum of 18 credit hours at the 3000 level or above in each of the primary and secondary subjects.
Mathematics as the primary subject
The Mathematics part of a Combined Honours program in Mathematics and another subject will be designed to suit the needs and interests of the student. However, the program must be approved by a Mathematics Honours Advisor and an Honours advisor from the other subject. Students will normally complete MATH 4950.03 Honours Research Project.
Mathematics as the secondary subject
The Mathematics part of a Combined Honours program in Mathematics and another subject will be designed to suit the needs and interests of the student. However, the program must be approved by a Mathematics Honours Advisor and an Honours advisor from the other subject.
Note: Students will not receive credit for taking MATH 1115.03 after receiving credit for MATH 1000.03, MATH 1500X, or MATH 1215.03
BSc (120 credit hour) Major in Mathematics
The 120 credit hour Major is suited to students who want to focus on Mathematics, but wish to have a program that is somewhat less constrained than the Honours program. Students in a Major program normally choose to concentrate in Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics or Mathematics Education.
Departmental Requirements
In addition to fulfilling the requirements outlined in the Academic Regulations and College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections, students in a BSc Major program in Mathematics must complete the following courses:
1000 level
• MATH 1030.03: Matrix Theory and Linear Algebra I 2000 level
• MATH 2001.03: Intermediate Calculus I/MATH 2002.03: Intermediate Calculus II

 Introduction
The Medical Sciences program is a 4-year Bachelor of Science aimed at students who wish to initiate studies in medical science as undergraduates. The program will introduce students to subjects such as human anatomy, physiology, neuroscience, epidemiology, and health ethics.
In the first two years of the program, students take core courses in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Statistics, Psychology, Microbiology, Sociology, Neuroscience, Biochemistry, and Physiology. These courses will not only provide a solid background in basic sciences, but will prepare students for admission tests for various medical sciences disciplines (such as the MCAT, DAT, PCAT, GRE), meet (or exceed) the early prerequisites for acceptance into medically related professional programs (such as Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing, Physiotherapy, Optometry, Ultrasound Technology, Radiological Therapy etc.) locally and across the country, and meet (or exceed) the early prerequisites required for acceptance into biomedical sciences graduate programs at Dalhousie and across the country. In their third and fourth years, students take core and selective courses in various subjects within the medical sciences. These courses come from Pharmacology, Microbiology & Immunology, Physics, Anatomy, Pathology, Philosophy, and Community Health & Epidemiology departments. In fourth year, students will either pursue an Honours, with an associated research project, or a one-term case-based Capstone course.
Career path advising and the course selection process are critical to the success of the Medical Sciences undergraduate program. In addition to guidance with respect to health-related programs and their entry requirements, academic advising is provided so that students are aware of what courses are required should they want to enter graduate programs in the various biomedical science disciplines. Opportunities are available to concentrate in areas of special interest, explore scientific curiosities further, or fulfil professional school

prerequisites. Students will graduate with a broad biomedical science background that will prepare them for a variety of clinical professional programs, graduate school, employment in the biotechnology industry, health administration, and in government.
Degree Programs
The curriculum offers core courses from 14 different departments, providing a broad background in biomedical science and a guided learning experience throughout the program. Students are also required to take a minimum of 21 credit-hours in “Selective” courses (chosen from a predetermined list provided by the program) in relevant medical sciences fields. These selective courses allow students to focus their interests in a particular area (including advanced courses in year 4), explore their interests further, and fulfil professional school prerequisites. Furthermore, for those interested, selectives will aptly prepare students in pursuit of senior research projects, subsequently providing the necessary groundwork to be excellent candidates for graduate programs in a specialized field at Dalhousie or elsewhere in Canada.
NOTE: Most second and third year core courses in the Medical Sciences curriculum have prerequisites with minimum grade requirements in those prerequisite courses. Please consult the appropriate calendar section for these requirements.
The program also offers 21 credit hours in open "Electives", which allows students to take any course offered at Dalhousie (at the appropriate level). Students are encouraged to fulfil the Writing requirement using one or both Electives in the first year and it is recommended that students take the writing course from the English department, since some professional schools require six credit hours in ENGL courses.
Students can choose to do a concentrated Honours in their fourth year, where they have the option of completing the research project at any Dalhousie research site, provided the Medical Sciences Honours Committee approves the project and supervisor. Despite the research site where students complete the project, they will still receive an Honours degree in Medical Sciences. If students do not choose Honours, they will take a case-based Capstone course that integrates multiple medical sciences disciplines by examining 5 medically-related cases, through expert lectures, group discussions, and student presentations.
The Medical Sciences program offers the following degree options:
• BSc (Medical Sciences) Honours - 120 credit hour
• BSc (Medical Sciences) - 120 credit hour
Students also have the option of doing a Minor. Core courses and required selectives may not be double-counted as Minor courses; extra selectives and electives may be used towards the minor. If a minor is added, students may find that they need to take more than 120 credit hours to complete all of their degree requirements.
Students should plan their programs of study carefully and are strongly encouraged to do so in consultation with a Medical Sciences undergraduate academic advisor.
Program requirements can be seen by following the links to the right. In addition, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Academic Regulations and College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections of this calendar.
A student is governed by the academic regulations in place at the time of initial enrolment, as long as the degree is completed within the time permitted (10 years). Subsequent changes in regulations shall apply only if the student so elects. Students applying the old academic regulations should consult the calendar of the appropriate year.

BSc (Medical Sciences)
The Bachelor of Science (Medical Sciences) degree is a 120 credit hour program, typically completed in 4 years. It will provide an educational experience that offers a broad, interdisciplinary background in all relevant subjects in biomedical sciences. The degree also meets the general degree requirements for the Faculty of Science. This program may fulfill the Dalhousie Faculty of Graduate Studies requirements for graduate school, but may not satisfy department-specific or other school-specific graduate school entry requirements.
Requirements
In addition to the courses listed below, students must ensure that they satisfy the requirements outlined in the "Degree Requirements" section for the College of Arts and Science. For the required Writing class, students can choose from the list of approved writing classes in the Academic Calendar. Before selecting a writing course, students are encouraged to consult the advising sheet available on the Medical Sciences program website, as some professional schools require an ENGL course as a prerequisite for entry.

BSc (Medical Sciences) Honours
Students who want a challenging program resulting in a broad background in medical sciences, including independent research experience, may want to enrol in the Honours program. An Honours degree in the Medical Sciences program aims to prepare students for future thesis-based graduate studies in a number of medically related fields. In addition to specific core course requirements with a minimum GPA of 3.0, students must identify a faculty member who has agreed to be their research supervisor. Students will have the flexibility to do their Honours research at a Dalhousie Research site of their choice (Faculty of Science, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences, or other), subject to the approval of the Honours class coordinator. All students conduct an independent research project in their final year under the supervision of a faculty member. Students must attend weekly classes, submit a satisfactory Interim Report and thesis, and deliver a satisfactory symposium presentation of the thesis research in a Medical Sciences student research forum.
Students should consult with an advisor and choose their electives and selectives carefully in their second, third and fourth years to ensure that they are prepared for Honours and potentially graduate studies in their field of interest. Students with an Honours degree will also be well prepared for entry into professional schools.

 Introduction
Microbiologists study small cells (microorganisms) and viruses. Among other things, immunologists want to know how larger organisms (such as humans) respond to foreign objects, many of which are very small. These two disciplines are thus inextricably linked, and when taken together comprise a major strength of the Dept. Another focus of the department is cancer biology, a natural fit with other interests, as cancers can be thought of as foreign objects, and many are caused by bacteria and viruses.
Degree programs in Microbiology and Immunology at Dalhousie focus on education and training in bacteriology, virology and immunology, with an understanding that biochemistry, genetics, and cell and molecular biology are also essential elements of a comprehensive academic program. A degree in Microbiology and Immunology provides a firm foundation for future employment in a variety of laboratory environments, for the pursuit of an advanced post- graduate degree, and/or for entry into the health professions (e.g. medicine).
Degree Programs
The Department offers the following degree programs in Microbiology and Immunology
• BSc (120 credit hour) Honours (Concentrated)*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Combined Honours*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Major*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Double Major*
• BSc (90 credit hour) Minor in Microbiology and Immunology
 1963
 
* BSc Co-op option available
* May be combined with Minors from other disciplines.
Departmental requirements for each degree program can be seen by following the links in the menu to the right. In addition to departmental requirements, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Academic
Regulations and the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections.
A student is governed by the academic regulations in place at the time of initial enrolment, as long as the degree is completed within the time permitted (10 years). Subsequent changes in regulations shall apply only if the student so elects. Student applying the old academic regulations should consult the calendar of the appropriate year.
Students should plan their programs of study carefully. It is recommended that students considering an Honours or Major program consult with a Microbiology and Immunology Academic Advisor prior to registering for second year classes.
Students who participated in the Integrated Science Program in their first year should consult the Undergraduate Calendar for first year course equivalencies. The following options fulfill the first year requirements for any Microbiology and Immunology program:
• SCIE 1515.36
• SCIE 1520.30
• SCIE 1540.27
• SCIE 1505.18
• SCIE 1506.09 and SCIE 1507.09

Co-op, Minors, Certificates and Engineering Concurrent Programs for Students
Co-operative Education Program (Science Co-op) in Microbiology and Immunology
Co-op Academic Advisor: Dr. D.B. Stoltz (dstoltz@dal.ca)
Science Co-op is a program where academic study in a science subject is combined with paid career-related work experience. Students undertake three work-terms interspersed with their academic study terms. Science Co-op degree programs enable students to apply their knowledge directly while providing them with work experience that assists in making educated career choices.
Science Co-op is available to students in BSc (120 credit hour) Honours or Major programs in Microbiology and Immunology, or in Combined Honours or Double Major programs with Microbiology and Immunology as the primary subject. The number of students admitted into Science Co-op each year is limited. A minimum GPA of 3.3 is required for admission and for continuation in the Co-op program as is a grade of B+ in MICI 2100.03. Students must be eligible to work in Canada.
Students normally apply to join Science Co-op during their first year of study. Students must apply before April 15, and it is strongly recommended that interested students meet with their Departmental Co-op advisor early in the Winter term of their first year. If accepted into Science Co-op, students must register for, and attend the Science Co-op Seminar Series (SCIE 2800.00) in the Fall term of the year they join.
Details are available from the Microbiology and Immunology Co-op Academic Advisor and from the Co-operative Education office www.dal.ca/academics/cooperative_education.html For more information on Co-op Education in Microbiology and Immunology, please see the Department webpage www.dal.ca/academics/programs/undergraduate/mbim/what_will_I_learn/coop_work_terms.html
Minors available to students in Microbiology and Immunology
Minor programs allow students to develop subject specialties in addition to their Major or Honours subjects. Minors in other subjects are normally embedded within 120 credit hour programs (including Science Co-op).
Students in a BSc (120 credit hour) program in Microbiology and Immunology may choose to include a Minor selected from the list of approved Minors. Courses counted toward a Major or Honours subject cannot be used to fulfill the requirements of a Minor program.

 Introduction
The primary goal of the field of Neuroscience is to understand the brain. Neuroscientists examine all aspects of the structure and function of nervous systems and use a variety of experimental strategies to understand them, including molecular, biochemical, behavioural, anatomical, physiological, and developmental approaches. The programs outlined below represent all of these approaches, with an emphasis on behaviour as the adaptive product of neural activity and neuroplasticity. Knowledge obtained from research in Neuroscience may be applied to a variety of human health problems, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and a variety of drug- or injury-induced behavioural disorders.
Degree Programs
The Department of Psychology and Neuroscience offers the following degree programs in Neuroscience:
• BSc (120 credit hour) Honours (Concentrated)*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Combined Honours*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Major*
• BSc (120 credit hour) Double Major*
• Minor in Neuroscience
* May be combined with Minor programs from other disciplines (except Psychology).
Departmental requirements for each degree program can be seen by following the links in the menu at the right.
In addition to departmental requirements, students must satisfy the requirements outlined in the Academic Regulations and the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements sections.
A student is governed by the academic regulations in place at the time of initial enrolment, as long as the degree is completed within the time permitted (10 years). Subsequent changes in regulations shall apply only if the student so elects. Students applying the old academic regulations should consult the calendar of the appropriate year.
Students should plan their programs of study carefully and are strongly encouraged to do so in consultation with a Neuroscience undergraduate academic advisor.

Programs for Students
Minors available to students in Neuroscience
Minor programs allow students to develop subject specialties in addition to their Major or Honours subjects. Minors in other subjects are normally added to 120 credit hour BSc or BA programs (including Science Co-op).
Students in a BSc (120 credit hour) program in Neuroscience may choose to include a Minor selected from the list of approved Minors (except Psychology). Courses counted toward a Major or Honours subject cannot be used to fulfill the requirements of a Minor program.
Certificates
In combination with a BSc in Neuroscience, students may obtain one or more Certificates. A Certificate indicates that a student has achieved a certain level of proficiency in a given area or subspecialty. Courses counted toward a Major, Honours or Minor subject may also be used to fulfill the requirements of a Certificate. Students must apply to the Certificate Coordinator to be considered for a Certificate. Certificates are awarded upon graduation and are noted on the student’s academic transcript.
A complete list of Faculty of Science Certificates and requirements can be found at the beginning of the Faculty of Science section. Students may also work toward obtaining Certificates offered by other Faculties; some of these are listed in the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements section.
Certificates of particular interest to students enrolled in a BSc in Neuroscience include:
• Certificate in Animal Behaviour
• Certificate in Science Leadership and Communication
        1991

 Introduction
Ocean Sciences includes the study of the physics, biology, geology, chemistry, and meteorology of the marine environment. Topic areas include ocean currents, waves, tides, marine sediments, oceanic crustal structure, nutrient cycling, acoustics, ocean-atmosphere coupling, biological production, marine biodiversity, and seawater properties, among others. Students enrolled in the Ocean Sciences program will be educated in the core oceanographic sub-disciplines of physical, geological, chemical, and biological oceanography, while also being exposed to issues in marine policy, law, and management. Graduates of the Ocean Sciences program will have gained an appreciation of the interdisciplinary and collaborative approaches often required to arrive at effective solutions to environmental problems relating to the oceans. They will have developed strong quantitative and practical skills, as well as a breadth of knowledge across ocean science disciplines. Ocean scientists are employed in research laboratories, universities, government agencies, and private industry. Career paths include environmental prediction, environmental monitoring and assessment, marine technology, marine surveying, marine resource use and extraction, and marine conservation.

Co-op, Minors, Certificates and Engineering Concurrent Programs for Students
Minors available to students in Ocean Sciences
Minor programs allow students to develop subject specialties in addition to their major or honours subjects. Minors in other subjects are normally added to 120 credit hour BSc programs
Students in a BSc program in Ocean Sciences may choose to include a Minor selected from the list of approved Minors. Courses counted toward a Major or Honours subject cannot be used to fulfill the requirements of a Minor program.
Certificates
In combination with a BSc in Ocean Sciences, students may obtain one or more Certificates. A Certificate indicates that a student has achieved a certain level of proficiency in a given area or subspecialty. Courses counted toward a Major, Honours or Minor subject may also be used to fulfill the requirements of a Certificate. Students must apply to the Certificate Coordinator to be considered for a Certificate. Certificates are awarded upon graduation and are noted on the student’s academic transcript.
A complete list of Faculty of Science Certificates and requirements can be found at the beginning of the Faculty of Science section.

 Introduction
How does the world work? What are the rules that govern how things happen? These are the questions that intrigue physicists who try to explain the great diversity of nature with the fewest and simplest hypotheses. They discover that there are underlying similarities between things that look very different on the surface. Good
 2027

physicists have the imagination to see these similarities, coupled with the understanding of the fundamentals of their science to determine the rules that govern the universe. Our programs are designed to allow you to learn physics in a systematic manner and understand how physics applies to the world around us.
Physicists are employed in many areas in universities, government departments and industry and are valued for their ability to discover and apply fundamental insights to a variety of situations.
This intellectual rigor can be applied in many fields beyond physics including meteorology, engineering, education, law, medicine, dentistry, health sciences, and business. Because practicing physicists often have knowledge of several fields, we have a number of combined programs with other science disciplines to provide that broader approach.
Our Honours program is our most comprehensive program aimed at those intending to become career physics specialists. Our various major and combined programs described below provide the opportunity to pursue a broad education in both physics and other areas.
First Year Courses
PHYC 1451/PHYC 1452 are general interest courses for BA students and are not acceptable as a prerequisites for further courses in physics. PHYC 1190/PHYC 1290, and PHYC 1310/PHYC 1320 both give a general introduction to physics, but each has its own particular approach and selection of topics.
PHYC 1190/PHYC 1290 is primarily for students intending to make a study of a physical science or engineering; it has regular labs, occasional tutorials, uses calculus, and is accepted as a prerequisite for advanced physics courses. Nova Scotia Grade XII Physics or its equivalent is a prerequisite. It is recommended that PHYC 1190/PHYC 1290 be taken consecutively, but PHYC 1190 is not a prerequisite for PHYC 1290.
PHYC 1310/PHYC 1320 is an introduction to physics that is oriented towards the health sciences and is primarily intended for students in biology, pre-medicine, pre-dentistry and allied health sciences. The course incorporates labs and tutorials, and is accepted as a prerequisite for advanced physics courses when MATH 1000.03 and MATH 1010.03 are taken concurrently. It is a good preparation for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Nova Scotia Grade XII Physics or its equivalent is highly recommended.
Students who are participating in the Integrated Science Program, and are interested in continuing in Physics, should consult the Undergraduate Advisor.
Second Year Courses
There are five 2nd year core physics courses (PHYC 2050, PHYC 2140, PHYC 2150, PHYC 2510, PHYC 2515). These courses are also suitable for students in other disciplines who would like to enhance their knowledge of physics. In particular, PHYC 2150 provides an opportunity to gain more laboratory experience, which is extremely valuable in many jobs.
Third and Fourth Year Courses
Not all courses are offered each year. Students should take careful note of the year in which each of these courses is planned to be offered. This information can be found at the department website http://www.physics.dal.ca
Prizes are awarded to the top students in each year of the program. Please refer to Awards. Degree Programs

Co-operative Education in Science is a program where academic study in a science subject is combined with paid career-related work experience. Students undertake three work-terms interspersed with their academic study terms. Science Co-op degree programs enable students to apply their knowledge directly while providing them with work experience that assists in making educated career choices.
Co-op is available to students in BSc (120 credit hour) Honours or Major programs in Physics, or in Combined Honours or Double Major programs with Physics as the primary subject. The number of students admitted into Co- op each year is limited. A minimum GPA of 3.00 is required for admission and for continuation in the Co-op program. Students must be eligible to work in Canada.
Students normally apply to join Co-op during their first year of study. Students must apply before April 15, and it is strongly recommended that interested students meet with their Departmental Co-op advisor early in the Winter term of their first year. If accepted into Science Co-op, students must register for, and attend the Science Co-op Seminar Series (SCIE 2800.00) at least four month prior to the first work term.
Details are available from the Physics Co-op Academic Advisor and from the Co-operative Education office www.dal.ca/academics/cooperative_education.html. For more information on Co-op Education in Physics, please see the departmental webpage www.dal.ca/academics/programs/undergraduate/pas/what_will_I_learn/coop_work_term.html.
Minors available to students in Physics
Minor programs allow students to develop subject specialties in addition to their major or honours subjects. Minors in other subjects are normally added to 120 credit hour BSc or BA programs (including Science Co-op).
Students in a BSc or BA (120 credit hour) program in Physics may choose to include a Minor selected from the list of approved Minors. Courses counted toward a Major or Honours subject cannot be used to fulfill the requirements of a Minor program.
Certificates
In combination with a BSc or BA in Physics, students may obtain one or more Certificates. A Certificate indicates that a student has achieved a certain level of proficiency in a given area or subspecialty. Courses counted toward a Major, Honours or Minor subject may also be used to fulfill the requirements of a Certificate. Students must apply to the Certificate Coordinator to be considered for a Certificate. Certificates are awarded upon graduation and are noted on the student’s academic transcript.
A complete list of Faculty of Science Certificates and requirements can be found at the beginning of the Faculty of Science section. Students may also work toward obtaining Certificates offered by other Faculties; some of these are listed in the College of Arts and Science Degree Requirements section.
Certificates of particular interest to student enrolled in a BSc or BA in Physics include:
• Certificate in Information Technology
• Certificate in Materials Science
• Certificate in Science Leadership and Communication

 Introduction
Psychology is an experimental science: Its purpose is to discover the conditions that control the activities of animals and people, to measure these conditions and the responses they produce, and to use this knowledge to predict and change behaviour. It is a subject for inventive but also scientifically rigorous people, better suited to those who want to find out for themselves than to those who want to be told what to believe.
Psychology at Dalhousie treats behaviour as a natural phenomenon, and in that sense shares much with the other life sciences. The boundaries that historically separated psychology from zoology, physiology, and cellular biology are blurred. As well, important ties are being made to such disciplines as anthropology, sociology, and philosophy. The student will find that the diverse subject matter includes three major levels of analysis: the organism, the organism’s biological machinery, and the broader social-environmental context in which particular behaviour patterns are expressed. Meaningful integration of these diverse levels and forms of analysis is an intellectual challenge of major proportions. Similarly, the time perspectives of immediate causation, development, evolution, and function all contribute to the modern approach to behavioural science and each must be evaluated in relation to the others.
A. Enrolment Limitations
Psychology is a popular program, and we have a high enrolment of students. Potential Major and Honours students, and those intending to enrol in the 90 credit hour BA or BSc Minor program in Psychology should note that there are limitations on the number of students that can be accepted into these programs in any given year. Passing introductory psychology courses with the required grade of B- and declaring an intent to Major in Psychology does not guarantee a place in any of these programs. Students are advised to register as early as possible for required courses to secure a space within a program.
There are strict size restrictions on individual courses. Lecture courses are limited by room size. Enrolment in laboratory courses is further restricted because of equipment limitations and requirements for supervision. All Major and Honours students, and those enrolled in a 90 credit hour program, should review carefully program requirements and choose prerequisite courses accordingly. Laboratory courses fill rapidly, and not all laboratory courses are offered every year.
B. Enrolment of Other Students
Only Major and Honours students in Psychology may enrol in PSYO 2000.03, PSYO 2470.03, and PSYO 2501.03, and such students are given preference in other second-year courses. All students must have at least a B- in both the
 2059
 
introductory psychology courses, or a B- in the psychology component of the Integrated Science Program, to be permitted to register in any second-year course in Psychology.
C. Laboratories
Psychology laboratories typically involve data collection and interpretation, and writing reports on the results.

 Introduction
It doesn't matter if you want to design computer games, study the safety of nuclear power plants, analyze the stock market or conduct political polls: scientists of all kinds work with numbers to measure and explore the world. That's where statistics comes in. Statistics is the study of the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. Extracting knowledge from data helps us plan for the future and improve our quality of life.
The Dalhousie Statistics program is the only program in the Maritimes that offers a full range of undergraduate and graduate programs. Our undergraduate courses are also approved by the accreditation committee of the Statistics Society of Canada, so that our graduates can apply for the Associate Statistician designation.
Statistics makes a great undergraduate degree with wide applicability and is an essential component of any program in the sciences or social sciences.

JOUR 2400 Science and the Media
CREDIT HOURS: 3
From the first Babylonian astronomical records on cuneiform to the public understanding of science on television, the various media have long been crucial to the success and spread of science. This course provides a history of science in the media from the ancient and medieval use of geometrical diagrams, astronomical figures and anatomical illustration through early modern printed texts, popular broadsheets and color botanical plates all the way to the ubiquity of science in literature, cinema and on the Internet. This expanding presence of science in the media is examined against the backdrop of three revolutions: literary and artistic (ancient and medieval worlds), mechanical (early modern period) and electronic (contemporary age). Specific themes considered include the increasing accuracy of scientific illustration, the rise of scientific journals, public scientific demonstrations, science in poetry and prose fiction, science and art, radio and television documentaries, the advertising and marketing of science, scientific apocalypses and techno- utopias, bioethics, Soviet era technological iconography, environmentalism and science-religion relations in the journalistic press, science fiction from H.G. Wells’ War of the Worlds to Star Wars and Jurassic Park, and science in computing and cyberspace. CALENDAR NOTES:
